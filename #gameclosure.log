08:01 < rampr> in android 2.3 versions we are seeing crash reports that "unable load library tealeaf"
08:01 < rampr> Any idea why ?
08:02 < rampr> Stack trace -> http://pastebin.com/mxGDdGu6
08:04 < rampr> sorry this is in android 2.2
19:24 < catid> rampr: that could happen if your build failed for some reason
19:25 < rampr> the build succeeded and works in other phones
19:25 < rampr> do you think some step in the build failed ?
19:28 < rampr> I see this warning Android NDK: WARNING: APP_PLATFORM android-15 is larger than android:minSdkVersion 8 in ./AndroidManifest.xml
19:29 < rampr> nothing else actually
19:31 < catid> what kind of phone is it?
19:32 < catid> perhaps we don't support that model
19:32 < rampr> catid: we are seeing the crash reports only on 2.2 and 2.3 android versions
19:33 < rampr> 1 sec, I'll tell you the devices
19:33 < catid> SDK version 8 would be 2.2
19:33 < rampr> yeah
19:34 < catid> so the projects build under devkit/addons/native-android/build/projectName/
19:35 < rampr> Galaxy Tab (GT-P1010), Optimus Chat (hazel), Milano (C5120)
19:35 < catid> you can run "ant debug" in a terminal at that path to create an apk
19:38 < rampr> I'll try that, we have a motorola droid running 2.2, I'll test with that
19:44 < rampr> same error
19:44 < catid> that should give you full control over all the android manifest settings etc
19:45 < catid> i'm worried maybe the new jpeg static library includes only armv7 code
19:46 < rampr> I'm using the 38 version of devkit
19:46 < rampr> was the jpeg library added later ?
19:47 < catid> yeah it was added in 39
19:47 < rampr> so that should not be it
19:48 < catid> we also added a bunch of other static libraries in 38 i think
19:48 < catid> libcurl etc
19:49 < catid> let me verify those are all armeabi armv5te machine code
19:52 < rampr> okay,
19:52 < rampr> I compiled whack the mole and I've put the build log here -> http://122.178.251.179:2222/build.log
19:52 < catid> thanks
19:56 < rampr> I just noticed somebody has reported the same crash with an older version of our app, that was using basil version 30
20:00 < catid> oh interesting
20:00 < catid> maybe the problem is this:
20:00 < catid> "settings for AndroidManifest: value for icons is not a string"
20:04 < rampr> that's the only error there
20:05 < catid> it could be that something important is getting skipped because of that error
20:07 < rampr> I opened the androidmanifest in the build/projectName, don't find any icons there
20:46 < rampr> I tried removing the icons object in manifest.json and the error doesn't appear in the build
20:47 < rampr> app still crashes, so it is something else I guess
20:52 < catid> hrm still looking at it
21:22 < catid> ok as far as i can tell we do still support armv5te in android builds
21:22 < catid> it's working on a galaxy y
21:23 < catid> and we appear to have armeabi and armeabi-v7a binaries
21:23 < catid> so i'm a little stumped!
21:23 < catid> have you tried running the latest devkit?
21:25 < rampr> no, haven't tried it, I'll try the latest devkit
21:25 < rampr> what version does galaxy y run ?
21:25 < rampr> I was reading this article - http://mpigulski.blogspot.in/2010/09/debugging-dlopen-unsatisfiedlinkerror.html, but got nowhere
21:25 < catid> 2.3.5 i think
21:26 < rampr> do you guys have a 2.2 ?
21:26 < rampr> we have a cyanogenmod 2.3 and it doesn't crash there
21:26 < catid> 2.2 only problem hm
21:26 < catid> i don't have one on hand
21:27 < rampr> the emulator ?
21:27 < catid> i'll try to find one
21:27 < rampr> thanks, I'll try latest devkit in the meantime
21:34 < catid> another idea
21:35 < catid> try removing some of the static libraries from tealeaf/jni/Android.mk LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES
21:41 < rampr> curl-prebuilt libzip cpufeatures libjpeg libpng libjansson libv8a andprof
21:41 < rampr> I'll remove curl, zip, jpeg ?
21:44 < catid> i have to download and install some things to use an AVD with the right specs so will take a while
21:44 < rampr> doesn't compile without curl, I'll add it back
21:44 < catid> try removing just one of those, like jpeg
21:44 < catid> ah yeah maybe that won't work then
21:44 < catid> right because it will complain about references..
21:45 < rampr> :)
21:46 < rampr> somebody had a similar issue here - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/android-ndk/xavfYBp2DaY
21:50 < catid> ah try compiling for android-8
21:50 < catid> i'll do that soon
21:50 < catid> need to install API level 8
21:51 < rampr> where do I set it to version 8 ?
21:51 < catid> in that build/projectName path
21:51 < catid> there's a project.properties file
21:51 < catid> edit that to target android-8
21:52 < rampr> okay
21:52 < catid> then run android update project -p .
21:52 < catid> from the build/projectName dir
21:52 < catid> doesn't work for me cuz it's still downloading
21:55 < rampr> then ant debug right ?
21:57 < catid> yea
21:57 < catid> there's a new android ndk out too: 9b that may have fixed something related to this
21:58 < rampr> [aapt] /Users/rampr/work/hashcube/devkit/addons/native-android/TeaLeaf/res/layout/edit_text_handler.xml:17: error: No resource identifier found for attribute 'textCursorDrawable' in package 'android'
21:58 < rampr>      [aapt] /Users/rampr/work/hashcube/devkit/addons/native-android/TeaLeaf/res/layout/edit_text_layer.xml:12: error: No resource identifier found for attribute 'textCursorDrawable' in package 'android'

21:59 < rampr> that's an error, not sure if it is version 8
21:59 < rampr> if it is because of version 8
22:00 < rampr> I have ndk 9b, 38 version doesn't work without that
22:01 < rampr> confirmed setting it to version 8 throws the above errors
22:01 < rampr> not able to build the binary too
22:04 < rampr> damn, it now compiles and I get an apk
22:07 < rampr> okay found out how to reproduce, I modified AndroidManifest.xml and changed targetSdk also to 8
22:09 < catid> ok
22:09 < catid> interesting
22:09 < catid> let me show this to the guy who wrote the edit text stuff
22:44 < catid> for now you can patch it by removing the textCursorDrawable property
22:44 < catid> the problem it solves is that the text color is wrong (white on white) so we disable the system theme that way
22:45 < catid> apparently it's supported on 2.3+ oops
22:50 < catid> though we're not sure if that's the issue you're seeing
22:50 < rampr> oh cool, I'll try it
22:52 < rampr> another one
22:53 < rampr> devkit/addons/native-android/build/whackthatmole/bin/AndroidManifest.xml:34: error: Error: String types not allowed (at 'configChanges' with value 'keyboardHidden|orientation|screenSize').
22:54 < catid> hrm
22:54 < catid> i guess keep removing keys
22:54 < catid> it seems less likely that this is the problem
22:55 < catid> most likely thing is that a dynamic library like libz has a different API on version 2.3+
22:55 < catid> pthread is another one we use
22:55 < rampr> compiled, apparently screenSizes doesn't work in api 8
22:55 < rampr> going to test on device
22:56 < rampr> oh okay,
22:58 < rampr> yes, still crashes
22:59 < catid> ls
23:00 < catid> shot in the dark maybe it's pthread stuff
23:00 < rampr> :hmm
23:04 < rampr> saw another crash with this stack trace earlier today
23:04 < rampr> E/AndroidRuntime(  281): FATAL EXCEPTION: GLThread 25
23:04 < rampr> E/AndroidRuntime(  281): java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No configs match configSpec

23:05 < rampr> don't remember the device I was trying, do you think it could related to this ?
23:36 < catid> oh there's nothing you can do there
23:36 < catid> that means that the device does not support OpenGL
23:36 < catid> we just give up in that case
23:37 < rampr>  oh okay, so unrelated
23:58 < catid> ok finally have a 2.2 emulator running
--- Day changed Tue Nov 19 2013
00:02 < catid> yup i see the problem in the emulator
00:03 < catid> hrm i think i need to enable OpenGL
00:05 < catid> maybe, if it gets that far
00:08 < catid> oh interesting
00:08 < catid> Android String class does not support isEmpty on this platform
00:08 < catid> may be causing a problem
00:11 < catid> updated the localnotify plugin to fix that
00:11 < catid> going to look for other usage
00:40 < catid> ok localnotify plugin is now compatible with API level 8
00:40 < catid> but that wasn't your issue
01:14 < catid> so
01:14 < catid> i was able to get an strace like in that blog post
01:14 < catid> by doing this: am start -n XXX && ps && ps && ps && ps && strace -v -p
01:14 < catid> in the simulator
01:14 < catid> and guessing what PID would be used next
01:14 < catid> for the app
01:15 < catid> but it doesn't print out anything useful
01:17 < catid> it shows the app reading the length of the .so file, then mmapping it
01:17 < catid> then closing, unmapping and printing errors
01:18 < catid> this is not entirely unexpected
01:18 < catid> the "missing library" is NOT one that we provide
01:18 < catid> it should already be present on the device
01:18 < catid> so the strace logs shouldn't show it trying to load something
01:19 < catid> or the library that has the missing function
01:30 < catid> ah here we go
01:31 < catid> ld.bfd libssl.so libcrypto.so libtealeaf.so -rpath=/copied22libs/ has no missing symbols!!
01:31 < catid> wtf
01:32 < Mazyod2> \o/
01:46 < catid> maybe we need to change the linker to use bfd
01:46 < catid> in our builds
02:43 < catid> getting close to giving up on this one
03:36 < rampr>  dozed off, it's morning here too
03:50 < catid> fixed it
03:50 < catid> the solution is complicated
03:50 < catid> i have had to hex-edit some .so files and change the load order
03:51 < catid> a few more things to fix in other places now
03:51 < catid> to get 2.2 support working again
04:39 < rampr> yay!
04:47 < rampr> why do the the .so files have to hex edited ?
15:52 -!- Netsplit *.net <-> *.split quits: catid, ronan1, chapel
16:00 -!- Netsplit over, joins: ronan1
19:18 < catid_> good morning
19:21 < catid> still fixing some issues for 2.2 support
19:21 < catid> some of them are my fault actually ^_^
--- Day changed Wed Nov 20 2013
01:10 < catid> verified on a real 2.2 device that everything is working again
01:10 < catid> i'm getting the changes approved by other developers now so ya'll should get it within a week
02:08 < bhldev> still haven't solved the adb takes a million years to upload problem
02:08 < bhldev> quite annoying
02:09 < bhldev> thank god for the simulator
02:09 < catid> wow that is odd
02:09 < catid> i've been uploading with adb all morning
02:10 < catid> seems reasonably fast
02:10 < catid> to various phones
02:10 < catid> though i actually cannot get the AVD to run our games
02:10 < catid> apparently it doesn't support ogles2.0
02:10 < catid> only 1.1
02:11 < catid> and we use shaders..
02:11 < catid> real android 2.2 (api level 8) phones do run our games though
02:11 < catid> AVD was useful to debug the problem rampr was reported
02:11 < catid> reporting*
03:41 < bhldev> it's obviously something wrong on my end I'm just complaining
03:43 < bhldev> btw is there some roadmap for gc somewhere or some plan for the next year or two

02:34 < bhldev> any way to download the gc docs for offline viewing
02:34 < bhldev> the site is hostile to wget and httrack
02:37 < catid> yeah if you just disconnect your computer from the internet and browse to the site it should display as normal
02:37 < catid> we have some special caching stuff turned on
02:38 < catid> so all the text content is saved to your disk
02:38 < catid> i think the pictures are stripped
02:45 < bhldev> also the menu in the dark blue is hostile to touchpunch and other mobile events so it can't be read on ipad
02:46 < bhldev> oh well can't be perfect
02:46 < catid> touchpunch?
02:47 < catid> ooh

16:11 < bhldev> how do you find the syntax errors in your application in the simulator
16:12 < bhldev> doesn't tell you what line in your code the error is
16:21 < bhldev> guess I have to use jslint
16:23 < bhldev> nvm it's right in the basil console
16:23 < bhldev> lol
16:29 < bhldev> btw for the basic list example at http://doc.gameclosure.com/example/ui-list-basic/ the init function for the FilmCell class has a textview, the textview should define size:11 in the options otherwise the text scales and the list is unreadable
23:26 < bhldev> the examples are the best practices for doing this?
23:26 < bhldev> for example the examples usually define one button class subclassing ButtonView then have a list of options, this is the way to do it?
23:27 < bhldev> for like 10 different buttons
--- Day changed Sun Nov 24 2013
01:26 < bhldev> for example http://doc.gameclosure.com/example/ui-grid-movecell/ the text "A button to change the number of rows" appears twice should be something else the second time
14:48 < bhldev> the "flex" option doesn't seem documented in the docs but is used in the examples for show or hide
14:50 < bhldev> nvm found it under layout
15:24 < bhldev> is it possible to do slice scaling with toasts?
15:28 < bhldev> nvm I found that too, inherits from ImageView so I can use all of ImageView ;p
15:56 < bhldev> btw icon.png is missing from the examples repo, needed for the first example for imageview

03:31 < rampr> any ideas why ?
03:44 < catid> that would happen if we were still trying to render from the background
03:44 < catid> should be very rare
03:45 < catid> i can imagine some long-blocking event on the render thread could cause that crash
03:55 < rampr> this could be related to an ANR ?
04:00 < bhldev> yes, three week vacation

06:04 < glassesmouse> Hello guys
06:04 < glassesmouse> I've got a question about the menus plugin that comes with devkit
06:05 < glassesmouse> I'm trying to resize the menus when user change the device orientation
06:05 < glassesmouse> I tried to use updateOpts() to update the TextDialogView width and height
06:05 < glassesmouse> but it doesn't work
06:06 < glassesmouse> the view still keeps it's original width and height
06:06 < glassesmouse> is there a way to resize the menu?
06:24 < bhldev> hi
06:24 < bhldev> glassesmouse: hi
06:24 < bhldev> I'm just a user don't work for gc, but I'm going through examples right now
06:26 < bhldev> try toasts, they extend ImageView and I had success using 9-slice scaling with them
06:27 < bhldev> I'm pretty sure that TextPromptView is bugged, was trying various options today and it didn't work but at the same time I'm pretty sure I would never use it because native dialog in a game would be way too ugly
06:32 < bhldev> http://doc.gameclosure.com/example/ui-toast/
07:17 < glassesmouse> bhldev Thank you for your suggestion! I'll try it out
08:08 < bhldev> I think the flex docs at http://docs.gameclosure.com/guide/designing-user-interfaces.html#flex should be updated to reflect that flex can also be non-zero non-one values
08:09 < bhldev> for example if it's 3 then the view takes 3/4 of the parent view width and height, seems to be an undocumented but useful feature
08:10 < bhldev> if there's two subviews one flex 3 one flex 1 then the one with 3 takes 3/4, only found it out buried in the examples

05:30 < bhldev> continuous is spelt wrong on the http://docs.gameclosure.com/ page under examples - animation
05:39 < bhldev> strangely the code in the example itself is not... so developers are better spellers than web designers ;p
07:36 < bhldev> the example at http://doc.gameclosure.com/example/animation-multibox/ here http://doc.gameclosure.com/example/animation-multibox/ should use your bind() function and animate.easeIn instead of animate.EASE_IN
07:36 < bhldev> it looks like a Java dev wrote that example lol

19:57 < jishnu7> catid, any chance of merging this ? https://github.com/gameclosure/native-android/pull/10
19:57 < catid> i was just about to make a release to fix the edittext on iOS
19:57 < catid> let me take a look
19:59 < jishnu7> I'm not sure whether this requires some other changes or not.
20:00 < catid> i will at least check to make sure that it doesn't break normal android builds that don't use it
20:00 < catid> have you tried it with your games?
20:03 < catid> merged it in, will test in a bit

01:12 < catid> ugh found a crash in Android native
04:32 < bhldev> what unit testing framework do you guys use
04:50 < bhldev> where is the documentation for this kind of code this._textView.onInputSelect = bind(this, "onClick"); should it instead be this._textView.on('InputSelect', bind(this, "onClick")); ?
04:51 < bhldev> from http://doc.gameclosure.com/example/sound-background/ looks like it's using a different way of binding events

12:24 < catid> yeah i've been working on some high priority stuff
12:24 < catid> we need to fix a big memory leak related to canvas
12:25 < catid> the new games are using a lot of extra canvases so they need to be garbage collected in the texture manager
12:25 < catid> which means i need to go back and edit and regression test all the fonts etc
12:25 < debarko> which version is it affecting?
12:25 < catid> once this is done i'll do another release
12:25 < catid> just internal stuff

00:22 < jaayden> Hi I have a question about the current state of TextEditView and TextPromptView
00:23 < jaayden> Does anyone here have any knowledge of the fix that is in the works for those Views?
00:39 < jishnu7> jaayden, what is the problem ?
00:40 < catid> good morning all
00:41 < jishnu7> good morning catid
00:41 < jaayden> for the latest release, when using texteditview or TextPromptView, this causes a crash in iOS on a device or in a simulator
00:42 < jaayden> I think it was some changes made in the native-ios repository in the last month but not sure
00:42 < catid> yes that's a known issue
00:42 < jaayden> I was wondering if I could find out what the fix is or if there is some advice of how to rollback
00:42 < catid> you can fix it yourself while you wait for us to get another release out by removing the count: selectors
00:43 < jaayden> ah ok, which file is that in?
00:43 < catid> from the places where it gets called
00:43 < catid> it's in a few objective C files, let me check
00:44 < catid> tealeaf/platform/TeaLeafViewController.mm
00:44 < catid> dispatchEvent now only has one selector
00:44 < catid> remove the 'count:' one
00:45 < jaayden> here [[js_core lastJS] dispatchEvent:&evt count:1];
00:45 < jaayden> just remove that parameter?
00:45 < catid> yeah remove count:1
00:46 < jaayden> is this the only location or are there multiple spots?
00:46 < catid> 3 locations in that file
00:47 < jaayden> ok, ill try that, one other thing, I only actually was able to get the TextPromptView to work as expected
00:47 < jaayden> is it possible now to use the TextEditView without a prompt appearing?
00:48 < jaayden> to type text directly in the textbox?
00:48 < jaayden> on an iOS device
00:48 < catid> hm
00:49 < catid> it may still have some bugs in the last release
00:49 < jaayden> I can use the promptview but was curious
00:49 < catid> we are using it for that; there is some trickiness with getting the text input to GO AWAY when the keyboard is closed
00:49 < catid> that is not entirely cleaned up yet but is working
00:50 < catid> the text input also cannot move once you fix it to the screen
00:50 < catid> so no reflowing
00:51 < catid> i've seen issues with custom keyboards on android
00:51 < catid> it's getting better because we need it to work :)
01:01 < jaayden> Ya, I was getting the issue where the keyboard was not appearing after tapping on the texteditview, but Ill try again today and see what happens
12:33 < bhldev> what kind of storage or db do games use with gameclosure
12:34 < bhldev> can I use something like yathit.com or indexeddb
12:45 < rampr> we use localStorage
12:46 < rampr> it is a key value store, everything being strings
12:47 < bhldev> theoretically there should be nothing preventing me from including an external js file with no dependencies that uses localstorage or indexeddb as a backend because the gc canvas is webkit right
12:48 < bhldev> guess only one way to find out
15:22 < rampr> bhldev: gameclosure itself exposes a localStorage api
15:22 < rampr> when testing on the browser, it uses html5 localStorage
15:22 < rampr> but on the device it is probably mapped to something else

01:49 < stet> Hi GC folks. Can someone point me to a simple paint example/demo for GC? i.e. just free draw with your finger...
01:50 < stet> Coding it for HTML5 canvas is easy enough, but I'd like to see how it fits into the GC framework.
02:03 < Rastikko> Hi
02:03 < Rastikko> How is game closure to do a professional project? It's in an ok phase or still need some more development
02:03 < catid> good afternoon
02:04 < catid> stet: to do drawing-type effects, we draw quads that look like line segments between each x,y point
02:04 < catid> it's a little awkward compared to the canvas version but runs fast in practice
02:05 < catid> there's an old demo project of mine that does the drawing: https://github.com/gameclosure/mitri
02:05 < catid> and x,y touch input is pretty simple to work out from the docs
02:06 < catid> over at http://docs.gameclosure.com
02:06 < catid> Rastikko: it's pretty mature at this point.  we've been using it for some popular mobile games on Android/iOS for over a year now
02:07 < catid> the majority of bug fixes are in new features for new releases
02:17 < stet> Ok, here's another total neophyte question: I built the "platformer" sample for iOS and in the XCode project it shows appropriate icons but when running in the emulator or on a device, the icon doesn't come through--it's an empty rectangle. Any idea why?
02:19 < stet> I'll check out your demo project--thanks for the link.
02:21 < stet> Just tried building Whack-that-mole for iOS and get the same generic blank icon despite an icon showing up in the XCode project.
02:23 < stet> All I'm doing is "basil debug native-ios" and then running the XCode project that opens.
02:24 < stet> Same thing for demoShooter.
02:26 < stet> They all work, but the icons don't get included. Sorry if I'm missing something obvious, but it kind of looks like a bug?
05:11 < bhldev> hrm wonder why people ask questions then leave
05:11 < bhldev> *real* programmers leave their computers on 24/7
05:12 < catid> it was in a web browser
05:12 < catid> just found a way to speed up iOS load time quite a bit
05:12 < catid> for our latest game we do a ton of localStorage updates
05:13 < catid> it turns out our localStorage implementation on iOS is synchronizing manually on each write
05:13 < catid> which takes about 500 ms
05:13 < catid> and we were doing like ~30 of these on startup
05:13 < catid> huge speed improvement for one of our games, and the others are snappy now
05:14 < catid> if you want to improve things just comment out the synchronize line
05:25 < catid> pretty nice improvement so i made a new 0.1.44 release for it

21:09 < stet> Hello again, GC folks. I'm back with more beginner questions...
21:09 < stet> Yesterday I was asking about icons not showing up when building for iOS. Still don't know why that is, but I tried building for native android and the icons seem fine there.
21:10 < stet> My Android-related question is regarding orientations. It appears the only options are portrait and landscape in the manifest.json file. The platformer example has landscape, but when I run it on a device it only allows one of the landscape orientations.
21:12 < stet> Looking in the AndroidManifest.xml that it generated, it appears that's because it specifies "landscape" rather than "sensorLandscape."
21:13 < stet> Any way to get "sensorLandscape" in the AndroidManifest.xml that GC outputs?
21:16 < stet> Also, sorry if this isn't the best place to be asking this stuff. Please point me to a forum or whatever, if one exists.

03:21 < bhldev> what's the market for casual 2d games like, still money makers?
03:22 < bhldev> saw a game on ipad where you drag a ninja around like a rag doll and do things to it and train and level it up and it was 3d... seen a half dozen 3d games in a row now
03:22 < bhldev> people playing them on the train bus etc., not just random
03:23 < Mazyod1> clumsy ninja is awesome
03:23 < bhldev> yeah that's what I saw
03:24 < bhldev> anybody ever try to do something to gc 3d, maybe three.js etc.?
03:24 < Mazyod1> Unity3D eats the 3D market
03:25 < bhldev> how good is their 2d stuff they just branched into that
03:25 < Mazyod1> it's nifty for those who like their visual and augmented goodness
03:26 < Mazyod1> it has most of what you would want in a 2d game
03:26 < Mazyod1> minus a tile map, mind you, i think that's not there
03:26 < bhldev> I can't stand that abstraction though if I wanted that I would use construct 2
03:27 < Mazyod1> I have no idea how people use construct
03:27 < Mazyod1> it looks so... simple
03:28 < Mazyod1> Unit has a skeleton animation system, splines, paths, particle systems, ...
03:28 < Mazyod1> it's the real deal when it comes to abstarction
03:28 < bhldev> guess I would go ejecta and three.js if I ever wanted 3d
03:29 < bhldev> or fastcanvas and phonegap
03:30 < bhldev> I hope I never have to stoop to that level but if 3d is the whole market I can't ignore it
03:30 < Mazyod1> I believe that the 2d market is still much bigger on mobile
03:31 < Mazyod1> I can count tens of top apps that are 2d, but not so much that are 3d
03:32 < bhldev> maybe that means it's easier to get in with a decent 3d app
03:32 < Mazyod1> that's an optimistic way to look at it
03:33 < bhldev> another issue is I'm not an artist
03:33 < Mazyod1> 3d is a nightmare then
03:33 < bhldev> more than 2d?
03:33 < Mazyod1> absolutely
03:33 < Mazyod1> all the steps involved in a sinlge asset
03:34 < Mazyod1> modeling, z-brush, painting, rgging, animationg
03:39 < bhldev> I will hire an artist anyway
03:39 < bhldev> guess I'm stuck with 2d for the forseeable future
03:44 < Mazyod> and I am back to my original nickname
03:44 < Mazyod> somehow

16:53 < Neco> hello
16:54 < Neco> anyone knows how to propagate an InputStart event after handling it?

17:39 < usandfriends> Hello GameClosure, Although your install script for MaxOSX is very user-friendly (I'm running it right now), all the logging from the script causes Terminal to slow down a lot. After the script finished, Terminal lags by ~10s and requires a restart. You should break up your script into may scripts that make the user restart Terminal or you should suppress all the logging information that comes from git and npm. Just a suggest
17:41 < usandfriends> Seems like you guys are sleeping! I'll put a comment in the support page.
17:42 < usandfriends> There is nothing in the support page yet, so I will just stay online so you can respond. :)

19:32 < bhldev> back up
19:33 < bhldev> got rid of windows as host at last from now on windows belongs in virtualbox only
19:38 < bhldev> safe to pull from git now?
22:01 < bhldev> anywhere I can look at box2d integration samples?
22:45 < bhldev> heh had a moment of weakness almost bought impact.js
--- Day changed Thu Dec 26 2013
06:16 < bhldev> anyone have experience running emscripten to get a working box2d then integrating with GC? not sure if it's worth trying
23:54 < bhldev> is your company called "gameclosure"? lol
23:54 < bhldev> I hope you have enough VC to last a few years

09:49 < scull> Hi everyone
10:05 < scull> I'm just discovering GameClosure and it looks great ! Nowadays, i try to develop a game with KineticJS and performances on Android Platform are very poor ! But, i've a question : i read documentation and tutorials, but i can't find if it's possible to make clic area based on svg path (like in KineticJS) ? The goal is to show a world map and catch the continent clicked by the player
10:10 < scull> So, i want to display only one picture (the world map) and make click area for each continents, based on path (many points wich make a polygon)
10:18 < scull> Does anyone have an idea to do this ?

22:46 < joshthecoder> I'm working on an add-on that requires some Android support jars. Is the best way to include them to copy/symlink them into my <addon>/android folder than add them to the config.json?
22:46 < catid> good afternoon
22:46 < catid> that's what we've been doing
22:47 < catid> i'm actually working on a mixpanel plugin right now for android/ios which is leading me to improve the plugin system to support more file types
22:48 < joshthecoder> only issue is if you have duplicate jars and dex will complain.
22:48 < catid> it's true
22:49 < catid> i don't think we have a way to check for duplicate jars by file name right now.  let me double-check
22:49 < catid> actually we do
22:50 < catid> if you add it to the config.json "jars" group
22:50 < catid> it will lump the jar in with all the other addons
22:50 < catid> and just use one instance of it for the build, or at least that is the intent
22:51 < joshthecoder> ah okay
22:51 < catid> was that not in the docs?
22:51 < joshthecoder> let me double check I may have looked it over
22:52 < catid> ok looks like i did a writeup here for the jars key: http://docs.gameclosure.com/native/android-plugin.html
22:52 < catid> but i didn't say anything about it trying to de-dupe the jars
22:53 < catid> lemme know if you think it should be in the docs or if the de-dupe is broken for some reason
22:53 < joshthecoder> okay thanks

04:56 < bhldev> so any news?
15:30 < bhldev_> nothing new for the new year?
18:38 < catid> bhldev_:  i think our plan is to prioritize stability
18:38 < catid> all of our efforts right now are going into developing products
18:39 < catid> and bug fixes will get tossed back into the public domain periodically
18:39 < jishnu> catid, any chance of supporting windows phone any time soon ?
18:40 < catid> the most recent figures place it at 2.5% of the global market
18:40 < joshthecoder> BB10 :)
18:40 < catid> so, we unfortunately do not have the engineering resources to target it
18:40 < catid> BB10?
18:40 < joshthecoder> BlackBerry
18:40 < catid> oh
18:41 < catid> i'm just repeating what the guys in charge are telling me about it
18:41 < catid> because we occasionally re-evaluate that
18:41 < joshthecoder> well games do work in html5 browsers so there's always that option I guess.
18:43 < jishnu> catid, so there is a chance of supporting wp in coming years ?
18:43 < catid> too early to tell
18:48 < bhldev_> catid stability is good just don't go bankrupt lol ever think about making a user friendly front end for all this stuff?
18:50 < bhldev_> maybe some code generation tools, drag pictures around, edit properties... might bring in more people
18:51 < bhldev_> I'm not sure if the html5 browser build still works
18:52 < bhldev_> one of the reasons to choose GC over other frameworks is html5 browser build
18:57 < bhldev_> anyway make lots of games and don't go bankrupt, that's what most people I know are afraid of with GC that you will disappear and people will have invested time in your framework for naught lol
18:59 < catid> i don't think we're in danger of disappearing anytime soon
18:59 < catid> we don't really have a money problem
18:59 < catid> no worries :)
19:06 < joshthecoder> do you guys host or know of any good meetups in the bay area?
19:15 < catid> meetup.com is a very rich resource here
19:15 < catid> we do have a thursday game night we host, and other startups typically hang out here
19:16 < catid> it might resume next week, will try to remember to tell you next week
19:26 < joshthecoder> cool
21:52 < bhldev_> catid_ good because I don't have a lot of cash I'm a starving microsoft line of business developer lol
21:53 < bhldev_> I think the primary reluctance of people is they don't want to expand beyond canvas and primitive operations because they think investing time in third-party tools could be overwhelming
21:53 < catid> by people you mean HTML5 engine developers?
21:53 < bhldev_> well too bad canvas doesn't have a scene graph, they will either have to reinvent the wheel or use something
21:53 < bhldev_> yeah I think so
21:54 < catid> yeah that was our impression too
21:54 < catid> we want to provide good tools for casual games that don't require incredible tooling
21:54 < catid> like 3D games
21:54 < bhldev_> well 3d is almost beyond casual
21:54 < bhldev_> you guys don't support three.js right
21:54 < catid> right
21:55 < catid> the real time savers are fast development time and code reuse
21:55 < bhldev_> anyway I think some vids or tutorials could help a lot maybe I will do something next year
21:55 < catid> on the software side
21:55 < bhldev_> yeah hobbyists don't care about speed they would rather spend two years and reinvent the wheel
21:55 < catid> our toolkit could be improved with better animation support to make the artists happier
21:55 < bhldev_> sorry guys I make a fuckton of money two years is a fortune lol
21:56 < bhldev_> I don't think artists will ever like it unless you make a construct2-like frontend
21:56 < bhldev_> or impact has a level editor too
21:56 < catid> well i still think that a flash animation importer would be really powerful
21:57 < bhldev_> eww flash
21:57 < bhldev_> lol
21:57 < bhldev_> yeah most devs are still flash cause you can do things with it
21:57 < catid> flash is how a lot of people like to work actually.. i've been told it's the dominant tool
21:57 < bhldev_> yeah me too
21:57 < bhldev_> if it was the only tool
21:57 < bhldev_> I would be gone
21:58 < bhldev_> when did you guys move from your own license to MPL?
21:58 < bhldev_> that was late in 2013 right
21:58 < catid> pretty soon after release
21:58 < catid> early 2013 i think
21:58 < catid> we had far too many complaints
21:58 < bhldev_> about license? lol
21:58 < catid> yeah, it required a splash screen
21:59 < bhldev_> yeah that would be bad that puts you in... what's that l company
21:59 < bhldev_> the one with the canvas accel
21:59 < bhldev_> ludei
21:59 < catid> right
21:59 < bhldev_> well
22:00 < catid> on the software side another powerful tool we explored was a time machine that allowed you to scrub execution of a live game back and forth
22:00 < catid> in the browser
22:00 < bhldev_> my suggestion is be less tight lipped about your projects if at all possible if people see you using the toolkit for games they know they would be more willing to use it also if you put out roadmaps or projects months in advance or ideally a year they would be less fearful of your company going kaput
22:00 < bhldev_> I think your last twitter or blog post is from october
22:00 < catid> it actually worked for simple games, but for our products it would get out of sync and the developer for it was not motivated enough to deliver it
22:01 < bhldev_> maybe you asked a lot of him lol
22:01 < catid> it was a lot yeah
22:01 < catid> very cool stuff
22:02 < bhldev_> anyway I think gc is underappreciated there's really not too many alternatives for a javascript engine
22:02 < catid> well we're rebranding the company soon and releasing more info, but i don't think i can give any details yet
22:02 < catid> so roadmaps etc are forthcoming
22:02 < bhldev_> it lacks physics engine, even though most games don't need rigid body physics most people see no box2d and run away... even though most box2d ports are horribly outdated
22:03 < catid> yeah C++ physics would be nice also, with JS callbacks on registered impact events etc
22:04 < catid> also explored the idea and decided not to do it
22:04 < bhldev_> casual games live or die by physics imo
22:04 < bhldev_> yeah it's a little too much
22:04 < catid> none of our games have realistic physics or physics puzzles
22:04 < bhldev_> should be easy way for other people to integrate javascript physics though
22:05 < catid> JS ports of box2d are very slow last i checked
22:05 < bhldev_> I think so too the only hope is emscripten ports
22:05 < bhldev_> I will try it next month when I'm not lazy see what happens
22:05 < catid> not saying physics puzzles aren't great, just that we haven't tackled it yet.  if our games team decided it was a good idea we'd port box2d to make it happen
22:06 < bhldev_> well sounds great
22:06 < catid> it's not a bigger challenge than any of the other things we solve each week imho
22:06 < bhldev_> yeah I don't think it is either
22:06 < bhldev_> you guys do great things
22:06 < bhldev_> now don't go bankrupt
22:06 < bhldev_> lol
22:06 < catid> =)
22:14 < bhldev_> oh and you need a real vbulletin type forum thing
22:15 < bhldev_> ok later
22:15 < catid> the google groups is OK i think
22:15 < catid> a lot of open source projects use that
22:15 < catid> later on
22:19 < bhldev_> well you could keep it but if you wanted people to talk about games, art or off-topic they wouldn't do it in google group you need a bbs for community
22:19 < bhldev_> anyway that's just my thoughts
22:19 < catid> true
22:20 < catid> one of our founders runs a popular BBS in his spare time; it's certainly doable
22:20 < bhldev_> or bitcoins
22:20 < bhldev_> I bought $5k usd in peercoins on monday it's up 40% I feel like a genius
22:20 < bhldev_> lol
22:20 < catid> bitcoins?
22:20 < catid> very nice
22:21 < catid> i owned a bunch of PPC and LTC for a while
22:21 < bhldev_> it will crash again though I will hold for a year or two... don't do it, 99% are ripoffs
22:21 < catid> they have definitely been up and down
22:21 < bhldev_> you cleared out?
22:21 < catid> yeah
22:21 < catid> in the last rally
22:21 < catid> since china got out of the game, the price has been too weird to buy in for me
22:22 < bhldev_> well china won't be able to stop it, government never can stop black market
22:22 < catid> so i'm in twitter stock right now
22:23 < catid> hope you're right.  BTC is fantastic for us geeks
22:23 < bhldev_> well I'm playing long game so I don't care about weird prices as long as fundamental is there... I think it is for LTC and PPC, almost nothing else
22:23 < bhldev_> I feel sorry for dogecoin
22:24 < catid> dogecoin was SUPPOSED to be a joke afaik
22:24 < bhldev_> if only the dev had taken it semiseriously and made it properly the marketing would have boomed it
22:24 < bhldev_> yeah
22:24 < catid> i don't trust LTC because most of the miners are botnet operators
22:25 < catid> because it's designed for CPU mining
22:25 < bhldev_> but if I was the dev as soon as i saw real people putting real money in it I would have either warned them or sent out a shit ton of patches to make it serious
22:25 < catid> heh
22:25 < bhldev_> yeah all my $ is in PPC
22:25 < catid> when BTC surged, LTC barely moved iirc
22:25 < catid> it's not trustworthy even as an investment tool
22:26 < bhldev_> I think that PPC will overtake LTC and get to 100
22:26 < bhldev_> when the 51% attack comes and it will come
22:26 < catid> PPC has some good engineering improvements; a friend explained it to me a few months ago
22:26 < bhldev_> on bitcoin rather... the 51% attack will be devastating
22:26 < catid> ripple is interesting too
22:27 < bhldev_> once bad news happens it's impossible to control it will be like bad restaurant reviews
22:27 < bhldev_> well no way I'm buying ripple
22:27 < bhldev_> I don't even completely get it lol
22:27 < bhldev_> and I can't anyway
22:27 < catid> yeah i haven't done my due diligence with ripple either so cannot talk about it
22:27 < bhldev_> I"m in Canada and I don't want my money overseas so I can only buy from Vault of Satoshi or other North American exchanges
22:28 < catid> icic
22:28 < bhldev_> I know ppc won't make me rich but if it gives me enough $ to finally kill the student loan I'll be happy
22:28 < bhldev_> if not oh well it was fun and a tiny drop
22:29 < bhldev_> I was going to make vids to show people how to do it but I don't want grandma buying 10k of it and losing it all or high school kid dropping out to do it so
22:29 < catid> heh
22:30 < catid> what i've learned about gambling is to be happy with 10% returns and GET OUT
22:30 < catid> because it's often possible to be *up* at some point.  but if you keep playing, the house wins
22:30 < bhldev_> anyone who knows how to do it wouldn't need vids anyone who doesn't know shouldn't get into it
22:31 < catid> on 10% returns you can get the same benefit of working a contracting job or two for much less work
22:31 < bhldev_> http://brianlimdev.blogspot.ca/ I posted about bitcoin seriously thinking of removing it and def not uploading the vids on how to buy it yet
22:31 < bhldev_> maybe I'll upload the vids but put a big disclaimer
22:32 < bhldev_> yeah it seems not worth it
22:33 < catid> i like the black theme blog
22:33 < bhldev_> maybe it's worth it for people who can't make money any other way but if you can't make money any other way then shouldn't be wasting money on stupid shit
22:34 < bhldev_> def all the time I spent on this already is a big money loser I could have done the usual contract work and gotten more
22:34 < bhldev_> thx
22:34 < bhldev_> I'm not going to spend any more time on it, put the coins on a DVD and locking it up for a year or two
22:34 < bhldev_> any more time and it's a gip
22:35 < bhldev_> better spent on gameclosure
22:35 < bhldev_> lol
22:40 < catid> GC is a great project.. i mean even if i didn't need money it would be a great project
22:40 < catid> i've been coding for like 19 years now
22:40 < catid> it's about the artistry too
22:42 < bhldev_> well I like that it's a foundation for my data driven game ideas so I don't have to solve bullshit platform problems
22:42 < catid> sorry to get philosophical about it :)
22:43 < bhldev_> I also like the documentation
22:44 < bhldev_> gc is low level enough to make me feel smart but high level enough so it's not a pain in the nuts
22:44 < bhldev_> I couldn't stand using a "level editor"
22:44 < catid> well you're chatting proficiently on *IRC*
22:44 < catid> so you're definitely not a drag and drop person
22:44 < bhldev_> maybe
22:45 < bhldev_> aren't there irc clients for bozos?
22:45 < bhldev_> idk never looked lol
22:45 < bhldev_> I assumed there are like ICQ
22:45 < catid> ogod ICQ
22:45 < catid> just dated yourself :P
22:46 < bhldev_> oops
22:46 < catid> i still remember my ICQ #
22:46 < catid> it's burned forever into my brain
22:46 < bhldev_> I don't and I wish i did because there were so many girls on it
22:46 < bhldev_> they're probably all married now lol
22:47 < bhldev_> actually I'm timeless one time I talked to some old fogey on the bus about C64 and TRS-80 and he was shocked I knew about it
22:47 < catid> i started coding on a C64, never used a TRS-80
22:47 < bhldev_> I bet I'm 15 years younger than you
22:47 < catid> 29.5
22:47 < bhldev_> ah well don't worry I'll pay for your pension
22:47 < bhldev_> lol
22:48 < bhldev_> ok bye and don't go bankrupt fire people if you have to lol
22:48 < catid> are you 15? :)
22:49 < bhldev_> no
22:49 < bhldev_> you have been coding since 10 years old?
22:49 < catid> yeah
22:49 < catid> used to write BASIC in daycare, sort of stumbled on it by accident trying to play games
22:49 < bhldev_> funny
22:49 < bhldev_> my favourite game was... crush crumble and chomp
22:50 < bhldev_> I used to steal newspapers to look for weird phone numbers to call and find underground bbses
22:50 < bhldev_> ok bye lol
22:50 < catid> later on

20:28 < athos> hey, can anybody tell me how i can prevent my application from entering sleep mode within this framework>?
20:43 < bhldev> there's a setting
20:43 < bhldev> maybe manifest.json
20:55 < Guest71418> ivlookedi n teh documentaqtion and i couldnt find anything, i know in native ios you can use, "[UIApplication sharedApplication].idleTimerDisabled = YES;" is there anyway i can put that into manifest.json?
20:59 < bhldev> dunno ask catid
21:48 < oodavid> Is there a way to do complex masks / cropping using multiple Views? Say 3 "spotlights" that move independently
22:03 < oodavid> All that I can see on the docs is a "clip" property of UI-View objects
--- Day changed Sun Jan 05 2014
02:21 < bhldev> oodavid: you can set z or sort order for view
02:22 < bhldev> I don't think masking that would require polygon hitbox and all there are is circles and squares
02:33 < oodavid> I'm not sure I follow - is there a preferred site for code so I can send an example?
02:37 < bhldev> I don't work for gc I'm just a normal guy
02:37 < bhldev> sec
02:40 < oodavid> no worries
03:00 < bhldev> oodavid: http://docs.gameclosure.com/guide/designing-user-interfaces.html#layout-order
03:01 < bhldev> then you would use images with transparency to achieve the desired effect

19:27 < catid> one of our games used accelerometer for input so no touch input
19:27 < catid> meaning the game could appear idle to android
19:27 < catid> or ios
19:27 < catid> to fix that i implemented a stayAwake feature on the device object:
19:27 < catid> device.stayAwake(true);
19:27 < catid> be sure to import device;
19:28 < catid> that will work until your app is backgrounded, and then the normal system power saving stuff will run
19:28 < catid> i'm pretty sure when your app comes back into focus it will resume staying awake
19:28 < catid> you may want to test that
19:28 < catid> if not you can run it again
19:56 < catid> there is now a "mixpanel" plugin for https://mixpanel.com integration
19:56 < catid> will be in the next release of the documentation

00:42 < csantovsky> hey guys, are there any closure workers here?
00:44 < catid> hello
00:44 < catid> csantovsky: i may be able to help
00:44 < csantovsky> I found a couple of thing that could be improved in the basil installation script
00:44 < csantovsky> just wanted to report that
00:44 < catid> great!  could you submit a pull request to github?
00:45 < csantovsky> regarding one of them, yes
00:45 < csantovsky> the second problem is the link to the registration form
00:45 < csantovsky> it requires permission
00:46 < catid> ah interesting.  i haven't done anything with that registration info for a long time
00:46 < catid> please open a github issue for anything you see that's wrong
00:47 < csantovsky> will do that
00:47 < catid> thanks! :)
00:47 < csantovsky> no problem
14:46 < Godefroy> Hey ! catid , is there  a simple way to get screen physical size with GC ?
18:10 < catid> i think so Godefroy
18:11 < catid> lemme check
18:11 < catid> import device;
18:11 < catid> device.screen.width and device.screen.height
18:11 < catid> i believe those are in pixels
18:29 < Godefroy> catid: thx, but I wondered how to get the physical size in cm or in inches
18:29 < catid> oooh
18:29 < catid> that's not exposed to JS
18:29 < catid> it would be different on each platform
18:31 < catid> there is a device.screen.devicePixelRatio
18:31 < catid> i think that just allows you to detect retina screen mode on iOS
22:43 < catid> there is now a new Accelerometer plugin up!
22:43 < catid> it now supports a shake gesture that works pretty well on android/ios
22:43 < catid> if projects of yours are using the accelerometer plugin they will get broken by the new API
23:11 < bhldev__> minus 50
23:14 < catid> am i getting points taken off for that? :)
--- Day changed Wed Jan 08 2014
00:42 < catid> i can't think of a way not to break users of the old accelerometer API - they were receiving events constantly, which most apps using the accelerometer do not need, so it should be off by default
00:43 < catid> so that we can ship the accelerometer support in all our games but only use it when it's needed the API had to change
00:43 < catid> it's also conveniently wrapped in JS now
01:06 < bhldev__> no it's minus 50 outside
01:06 < bhldev__> lol
01:06 < catid> heh

14:43 -!- Netsplit over, joins: oodavid
22:36 < oodavid> I get a lot of [warn] messages when using basil; various messages and warnings - running  on Ubuntu 13.10, the simulator works OK but am attempting to install android-native in order to test
22:37 < oodavid> Few questions: is it an isse? am I better of using a Mac?
22:39 < catid> i get lots of [warn] messages too
22:39 < catid> it should be OK
22:40 < catid> you may want to pay attention to them, because i tried to put helpful hints in those messages
22:40 < catid> you would be better off using a Mac because that's what we use
22:41 < catid> but i wouldn't ask you to buy a whole new computer just for that reason heh
22:42 < Euan> He'd ask you to buy a whole new computer for entertainment, not practicality ;)
22:43 < catid> ^
22:43 < Euan> Might be in your next of the wood later this year, catid
22:43 < catid> oh yeah?
22:44 < Euan> Got my graduate application in to Google Mountain View
22:44 < catid> nice!
22:44 < Euan> Friend who works at their Chicago office gave me an internal referal, which should help. For now I'm just crossing my fingers and hoping :)
22:45 < catid> i hope it works out
22:45 < oodavid> Congrats Euan!
22:45 < Euan> If I get it we can do that meet up for lunch :P
22:45 < oodavid> Are most of the GC lot in California?
22:46 < catid> our offices are on Castro street, a couple mines from the Google Mountain View campus
22:46 < catid> miles*
22:49 < Euan> Should probably head to bed so I can be awake tomorrow. Taking my old landlord to court for unlawful charges, probably sensible to be awake to say my piece.
22:50 < catid> best of luck with everything! :)
22:50 < oodavid> Yeah good luck!
22:50 < Euan> Cheers! ^_^
22:51 < oodavid> catid: maybe for the [warn] messages you should use 1;33 (yellow) to make them look less ominous?
22:52 < catid> should be easy to do, i'll add it to my TODO list
22:54 < oodavid> what a guy
22:58 < oodavid> Am trying to build for android and getting a few errors - http://pastebin.com/djEWT07N - lines: 25, 53, 58 - are they familiar?
22:58 < oodavid> I can build native android apps OK, just not via basil
22:59 < catid> lemme see..
23:00 < catid> it looks like the problem is this: [warn]  Error: could not open `/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.06/jre/lib/amd64/jvm.cfg'
23:00 < catid> those other warnings are nothing important - it just means the google closure compiler for JS is choking on the syntax
23:01 < catid> it will still run fine but that file won't be minified
23:01 < catid> i guess maybe you have jvm installed as root?
23:02 < catid> and you're doing a build from a normal user account?  something like that..
23:02 < oodavid> I'll try building as root :-)
23:03 < oodavid> TBH it was a while back when I installed java et al
23:06 < catid> there may be documentation on our website in the install section that has instructions for what JVM to install
23:07 < oodavid> There is for general GameClosure installation; git, node, java
23:08 < oodavid> and for android the usual, android sdk, ndk but no mention of java version
23:10 < catid> ah sorry it's terse there.  i haven't done much with linux
23:12 < oodavid> Not a problem, you shouldn't have to muck about with general Linux nonsense :-)
23:13 < oodavid> I think you're right about it being installed as root though
23:13 < oodavid> I'll rectify that and see how I get on
23:14 < oodavid> Out of curiosity, does GC offer a code-review service?
23:15 < catid> we haven't so far
23:16 < catid> if you contact Carter@gameclosure.com you may get a response if it's a business question
23:16 < oodavid> Cool, really enjoying working with the devkit, my only complaint is the size of the community for bouncing ideas / finding code; am painfully aware that I'm mostly in cotact with the devs themselves
23:17 < oodavid> ^I might do that in the future :-)

01:10 < csantovsky> hey guys! so I noticed gameclosure emulates the 2d canvas by internally using opengl es
01:11 < catid> csantovsky: yes
01:11 < csantovsky> since I was originally expecting it to emulate the 3d canvas (aka webgl), like (I believe) cocoonjs does, now I wonder if there's a way to send custom shaders to gameclosure
01:14 < catid> it would involve editing the native code for your target
01:14 < catid> here's an overview of the native code: http://docs.gameclosure.com/native/native-stack.html
01:16 < csantovsky> catid: you mean the platform specific code or would it be feasible by changing the native core module? I know both android and iOS use opengl ES, but I am not familiar to their specifics
01:18 < catid> i think most of the required changes would be in C
01:18 < catid> but any new exposed JS functions would require at least a few changes on each architecture
01:23 < csantovsky> I see. I'll check the native core module and try to see what kinds of changes would be necessary for this
01:23 < csantovsky> thanks
04:47 < debarko> catid, u there?
04:47 < debarko> need to understand the reason for having the receiver for install_referrer
04:47 < debarko> i want to deactivate it cause some other plugin i have made needs to get the install referrer.
04:47 < debarko> catid,

14:57 < Godefroy> hi!
14:57 < Godefroy> losure
14:58 < Godefroy> oups, irc client error
17:52 < Godefroy> Euan: hum ok but do you know the name of the parameter to put in it?
17:53 < Euan> Godefroy: If it's that same issue, same as you would in the project
17:54 < Godefroy> I don't find any info about that in the doc :-(
17:55 < Euan> It was a weird thing at the time
17:59 < Euan> But was something about the manifest.json in the GC directory being used over the one in the project
17:59 < Euan> Probably fixed by now.
18:02 < Godefroy> ok, anyway, it can wait
18:03 < Godefroy> I currently have an issue with images, I get this error (on Android):
18:03 < Godefroy> {tex} Unloaded 1 stale textures. Now: Texture count = 18. Bytes used = 118579200 -> 51470336 / 100000000
18:03 < Godefroy> and some images don't appear on some devices (on a Nexus 7)
18:04 < Euan> Tried deleting the bin directory and rebuilding?
18:04 < catid> good morning
18:04 < Euan> Morning catid
18:04 < Godefroy> morning catid :)
18:04 < catid> Godefroy: that doesn't look like an error message.  stale textures get unloaded whenenver the memory limit is reached
18:05 < Godefroy> oh ok
18:05 < catid> ok to do a release build, you should provide the signing key
18:05 < Godefroy> I have a lot of messages like this on our isometric map (we developed our own isometric engine) and it's really slow
18:05 < catid> since release builds are intended for store release
18:06 < Godefroy> on desktop it's ok, but on android it does'nt work as excepted
18:06 < Godefroy> catid: is there a documentation page about signing key?
18:06 < catid> so for android release builds, edit your config.json under your devkit folder
18:06 < catid> there should be lemme check
18:07 < catid> yes it's under the "setup" section: http://docs.gameclosure.com/native/android-setup.html
18:07 < catid> this shows you how to create a keystore and install it in the config file
18:09 < catid> Godefroy: what type of images are not displaying?  is it an alternative format like GIF?  we currently support JPEG and PNG
18:12 < Godefroy> thank you! I was searching in the page "Building for Android"
18:12 < Godefroy> no, only png
18:12 < Godefroy> and only on one device
18:12 < Godefroy> (even if I build again with --clean)
18:24 < Godefroy> oh, I have this error too: {core} WARNING: OpenGL error 1281
18:42 < catid> hm
18:43 < catid> seems tricky to debug without more info
18:43 < Godefroy> yep I understand :-(
18:43 < catid> you could turn on TEXMAN_VERBOSE in texture_manager.c
18:43 < Godefroy> ok
18:44 < catid> reproduce the problem, then send me the log transcript
18:54 < Godefroy> I don't see more errors in the debug console with TEXMAN_VERBOSE enabled
18:54 < Godefroy> I precise I built the app with this command: basil debug native-android --clean --open
19:03 < Euan> Try basil build native-android --debug --clean --open (if that still works)
19:05 < Godefroy> it's equivalent, isn't it?
19:06 < Euan> Should be. But never assume quirks won't happen.
19:09 < Godefroy> ok I just tested, it's exactly the same
19:10 < Euan> Ah well
19:10  * Euan got something to work over summer by using the build version
19:18 < catid> Godefroy: image loading seems to be pretty solid for PNGs in general
19:18 < catid> remote image loading can be a little flaky for the usual reasons
19:18 < Godefroy> yes of course :)
19:18 < catid> especially if the image that is missing has been sprited with other images that are showing up it's probably more related to the JS view containing the image
19:19 < catid> for instance if the view is hidden
19:19 < Godefroy> weird
19:19 < catid> or if the aspect ratio of the phone is causing a layout issue
19:19 < Godefroy> it's working quite well in the browser, on a Nexus 4 and on a Samsung Note
19:19 < Godefroy> *Note 2
19:20 < catid> you could try changing the size of the image to be smaller
19:20 < catid> how large is it?
19:20 < Godefroy> the same problem appears with other images that are really smaller
19:20 < Godefroy> but this happen always with the same images
19:21 < PierrickB> Hi
19:21 < catid> if you're on a mac try running "file build/debug/native-android/spritesheets/*.png" from your game folder
19:21 < catid> PierrickB: hello
19:22 < catid> it will show you the sizes of all the spritesheets - i'd like to see
19:22 < catid> you may want to check if the images that are missing are all sprited together
19:23 < Godefroy> I'm on Linux but whatever :)
19:23 < Godefroy> http://pastebin.com/2txwXysw
19:25 < catid> some real phones may have trouble with graphics larger than 1024x1024
19:25 < catid> it looks like a lot of your graphics are larger than that
19:25 < Godefroy> yep
19:25 < Godefroy> lemme test with a smaller image
19:25 < catid> what will happen is the image will not display on screen
19:26 < catid> i'm not sure if a GL error will happen
19:28 < Godefroy> indeed, it works with smaller images!
19:28 < Godefroy> thanks a lot!
19:28 < Godefroy> we'll be careful about that
19:29 < Godefroy> that's too bad, because we have beautiful big background illustrations, and we'll have to cut them
19:29 < catid> you can squish them smaller..
19:47 < PierrickB> catid:is this linked to GC or to Android/ios ?
19:53 < catid> PierrickB: limitation of mobile GPUs
20:39 < oodavid> Reading the performance guide; I have a fundamental question regarding object {} re-use / reference
20:41 < oodavid> If I want to swap object references (a lot of them) could I used a common "swap" object and not worry about memory leaks?
20:43 < oodavid> or do references not come with any additional overhead (ie I could make new references every time instead of using a "swap")?
20:47 < catid> references are like pointers
20:47 < catid> by analogy, changing a pointer doesn't allocate memory
20:48 < oodavid> shplendid
20:48 < oodavid> catid: what's you're role in the company? I see you everywhere!
20:48 < catid> i'm a random software dude
20:49 < oodavid> haha, thought as much; a dark horse!
20:50 < catid> that's generous!
20:52 < Euan> They see him here, they see him there, they see the catid everywhere
20:53 < catid> hopefully will see you guys all over the top app charts
22:04 < tomh-> hey guys, did the license change to mozilla just recently?
22:10 < Euan> Months ago
22:11 < Euan> The old one still lurks in some places
22:11 < tomh-> ah ok, so how does gameclosure make money now?
22:12 < catid> gameclosure is a startup
22:12 < tomh-> yeah, but whats their business model?
22:13 < catid> for business questions please correspond with carter@gameclosure.com
22:13 < tomh-> oh it was just out of curiousity
22:15 < oodavid> gameclosure isn't actually a gaming platform, it's a game. We're just playing an ultra real game development simulator... right?
22:16 < catid> we've been found-out
22:16 < tomh-> haha
22:17 < catid> that would be funny if we could gamify making games
22:17 < Euan> There definitely isn't a game of that
22:18 < catid> you can spend the 100 points you get for making a new UI screen on buying a fancier splash screen
22:21 < tomh-> btw, are game closure games only meant to be deployed in the appstores or is it still sane to offer the html5 version online as well?
22:22 < catid> we don't spend much time on the HTML5 build, so it may not work as well
22:23 < tomh-> ok

13:29 < Godefroy> hi
13:29 < Godefroy> how can I handle HD and Full-HD versions of our app with GC?
13:48 < oodavid> Godefroy - that really depends on what you want to achieve
13:49 < oodavid> My approach is to analyse the device dimensions and pick the right resource for the job
13:49 < Godefroy> our game has a lot of illustrations, and we want to have the best possible quality on every device
13:50 < Godefroy> so I guess we can build 2 version : HD (1280x720) and Full-HD (1920x1080)
13:50 < oodavid> Well, unless you render your sprites for every conceivable resolution there will always be a compromise
13:50 < oodavid> Oh I see, so only HD and Full HD? Are you not bothered about other resolutions?
13:54 < Godefroy> it would be too complicated to manage more resolutions, nope?
13:54 < Godefroy> are you thinking about lower resolutions? higher? intermediate?
13:55 < oodavid> You say more complicated, but I think if you approach it right then you could be OK
13:55 < oodavid> Have you read this yet: http://docs.gameclosure.com/guide/scaling.html
13:56 < oodavid> It's a good starting point, but I think you need to elaborate based on your requirements
13:57 < oodavid> My approach (I'm not a GC dev) is to break it down into two parts:
13:58 < oodavid> 1 - First calculate which resource "set" you want to use based on device.width and device.height, I just have small, medium and large for now
13:58 < oodavid> so if I was using an old iPhone I'd want to use say resources/images/bg_small.png
13:58 < oodavid> 2 - For every Screen calculate your layout, percentages work well here
13:59 < oodavid> Of course, screens can be different proportions, so I've approached it with extremes in mind
14:00 < PierrickB> Doesnt that mean that you have all resources, in each size, on the phone ?
14:00 < oodavid> 4:3, 16:9, reeeeeaaaally wide, reeeeeaaallly tall, and square
14:00 < oodavid> ^yeah, but they don't have to get loaded
14:00 < Godefroy> ok thanks
14:01 < oodavid> it's a trade-off I guess, but my justification is that: I don't pay for the bandwidth (google / apple do) and those with antique phones are probably used to having no space left
14:16 < Godefroy> yes indeed
14:16 < Godefroy> but I'm worried about the app size
14:17 < Godefroy> because we'll have a loooot of images :)
14:17 < Godefroy> I think we'll begin with an HD version (1280x720) only and we'll give the possibility to load Full-HD graphics from our servers
14:18 < Godefroy> a lot of games are doing that, for example Jungle Heat
14:19 < Godefroy> afaik GC is not yet capable to load and store images from the internet and use them exactly like images in resources folder, right?
14:20 < Euan> It can use base64 encoded uris for images
14:20 < Euan> But you'll have to get and store them manually
14:20 < Euan> And that *can* be a bit of a bugger to do sometimes
14:52 < oodavid> What sort of game is everyone making?
14:59 < Godefroy> I'm working on a tactical MMO with geolocation with PierrickB, ronan1 and 3 illustrators:-)
15:21 < oodavid> Oh nice!
15:22 < oodavid> What role has the geolocation?
15:25 < oodavid> Akin to Ingress?
15:35 < Godefroy> short version: in a zombie apocalypse context, the player will have to conquer places with his survivors through tactical fights
15:36 < Godefroy> it's a solo and MMO game
15:36 < Godefroy> the places to conquer will be real places thanks to Google Maps
15:36 < Godefroy> *Google Place API
15:36 < Godefroy> we don't use Google Maps
15:37 < Godefroy> we're using OSM with the lib I developed: http://www.gameclosure.com/blog/2013/06/announcing-devkit-native-plugin-system-geolocation-plugin-and-map-library
15:37 < Godefroy> and the geoloc plugin
15:38 < oodavid> Sounds pretty cool!
15:38 < oodavid> Assuming you're in Europe by the time?
15:39 < PierrickB> Yep
15:40 < oodavid> UK?
15:40 < PierrickB> Nope, France :)
15:41 < oodavid> Bonjor, mon francais est terrible
15:42 < PierrickB> Haha, almost : 'bonjour'
15:43 < PierrickB> And you  oodavid, US ?
15:43 < oodavid> Like I say, pretty bad
15:43 < oodavid> Nah, UK
15:43 < PierrickB> Ha, a neighbor
15:43 < oodavid> Which works out quite well for me as mine is a side-project; the US wakes up in my evenings!
15:44 < PierrickB> Yep, that's a good timing ^
15:44 < PierrickB> But we are usually working pretty late
15:45 < PierrickB> So that's ok for us, we manage to get in touch with GC staff, usually around 6pm
15:45 < oodavid> They're a helpful bunch like, shame that the community is (as of today) quite small
15:47 < PierrickB> Yes, hopefully they are reactive. The community needs to grow , that's true
15:47 < PierrickB> Especialy for an open source progress
15:58 < Godefroy> yep, but GC is still not enough mature
15:58 < Godefroy> and a version number < 1 is scary
15:59 < oodavid> I've been finding it a pleasure to work with
16:00 < oodavid> Mind you, my app development skills are limit, mostly js based - Titanium Appcelerator, PhoneGap, A little native
16:00 < Godefroy> we are basing our whole business on this framework, so I hope it will last :-)
16:00 < oodavid> As for version numbers, in my main job (not games) I've promised to never get  v1.0 as I know I'll never be finished
16:01 < Godefroy> ahah
16:01 < Godefroy> yep, that's a point of view
16:01 < Godefroy> anyway, I find GC really awesome
16:02 < Godefroy> and I love developing a game for all platforms in JS
16:02 < oodavid> Reading between the lines I reckon they'll be around for an age
16:02 < oodavid> ^oh for sure
16:02 < oodavid> have you tinkered with the source code much?
16:03 < Godefroy> source code of GC?
16:03 < Godefroy> not really
16:03 < oodavid> yeah, some really excellent code in there
16:04 < oodavid> I've submitted a pull request relating to "animate" but am waiting for it to get accepted
16:04 < oodavid> hopefully soon, it's a refactor of the usual easings / tween libraries
16:13 < oodavid> Do you have a devlog anywhere? V. interested in your work
16:15 < Godefroy> not yet
16:15 < Godefroy> for now, I open source some contributions and some plugins on my github account: https://github.com/Godefroy?tab=repositories
16:16 < Godefroy> and we'll begin to talk about our game probably in 2-3 months
16:16 < Godefroy> we'll probably release it this summer
16:16 < oodavid> SO you have gaming experience already?
16:18 < oodavid> (tell me if I'm being annoying)
16:31 < Godefroy> I'm coding, so don't worry if I answer tens of minutes later :-)
16:32 < Godefroy> I developed and managed a browser game (in Flash with a socket server in Java) in 2005
16:32 < Godefroy> I was 16 and it was a great experience!
16:32 < Godefroy> after that, I developed www.eklablog.com, a french blogging platform
16:33 < Godefroy> now I built a little team and we have 10 millions unique visitors / month and the blogs we host
16:33 < Godefroy> oodavid: and you, what are you working on?
16:34 < oodavid> ^impressive resume good sir!
16:35 < oodavid> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaMVIdLbEpw < a very old prototype, it's a puzzle game based on building chemical compounds
16:35 < oodavid> wanted to make something original, but simple enough for a hobby
16:37 < oodavid> it's evolved quite a bit since then; I've been collating information on the Psychologicy of games / addiction - as you play the game you "unlock" cards that explain why it is presented as it is
16:42 < oodavid> My real weakness is design, layouts and proportion I can do, just not pretty pictures
16:43 < oodavid> I'm reluctant to get a designer or sound engineer on board till I have a playable prototype that I'm happy with
16:47 < PierrickB> It's one of the ahrd part
16:48 < PierrickB> We managed to get a awesome (really, a genius) graphist on board. He is the 4th and last associate
16:51 < PierrickB> And we got 2 graphist interns (they just started)
17:27 < debarko> catid, u there bro?
18:01 < oodavid> What's the scope of an imported file?
18:02 < oodavid> if I define variables outside of the "exports Class" closure are they local to that file?
18:18 < catid> good morning
18:18 < catid> only things you pass through "exports" are exported
18:21 < oodavid> splendid!
18:21 < oodavid> and good morning to you too
18:21 < oodavid> I've definitely over-engineered some of my variable logic, happy for the refactor cause it was nagging at me
18:22 < catid> will be here all day if you have other qs
18:22 < catid> i'm working on integrating zxing into the devkit
18:22 < catid> for QR code reading
19:54 < oodavid> ahh, QR codes, I see them everywhere but have to imagine there's a cohort of imaginary scanners
19:55 < oodavid> should really be a built in function of all phones
19:56 < oodavid> catid, is there a roadmap for GC? There's a google groups thread but it was hijacked by webview conversation
20:07 < catid> for a while now we've been working on a product full time, and any improvements to the devkit from that are shared with you all

13:03 < scull> Hi everyone !
13:04 < scull> I'm requesting helo about leadbolt plugin on android. I've done all the procedure describe in the readme, on the simulator, logs are good, but in my android phone, ads are not shown and this line appear in logcat : E/JS      ( 2593): {plugins} WARNING: Unknown event could not be delivered for plugin: LeadBoltPlugin , method: leadBolt "
13:04 < scull> Have you got an idea about this issue ?
14:09 < rampr> scull: looks like it isn't implemented right
14:11 < scull> do you think plugin is not implemented right or my own code ?
14:11 < rampr> no the plugin itself
14:14 < rampr> showInterstitial in android isn't implemented
15:27 < scull> ah ok, thx$
15:27 < scull> So, i must use an other ad provider ?
16:39 < rampr> scull: if you can modify the plugin you can, must be easy I guess
16:39 < rampr> you'll have to implement showInterstitial in the android part of the plugin and the js also has to be slightly fixed
16:43 < rampr> you can try chartboost, I've tried it
17:30 < scull> Thx it works !
18:12 < catid> good morning
18:13 < catid> sorry rampr i haven't seen that issue.  if you can find out how to reproduce it reliably i'll be able to look at it

21:53 < oodavid> I've noticed that GC converts folders of images into spritesheets (by sniffing the network); does this mean that we get the advantages of spritesheets just by dumping images into the same folder and using ImageViews?
21:55 < catid> yes
21:55 < catid> it's best to separate images into the views that use them though
21:55 < catid> this way, on a real device fewer sprite sheets need to be loaded
21:55 < catid> so have subfolders for images that are used together
21:56 < catid> ie. button 9-slices etc
22:00 < oodavid> Excellent; that gives me more flexibility for moving sprites around etc
22:01 < oodavid> So (for example), a match-3 type game, it'd make sense to have all the sprites together as they'll get recycled (a lot), right?
23:00 < catid> yes our match-3 game works that way
23:14 < bhldev_> I've been thinking a lot about recreating a GC like view hierarchy in a lot of other game engines
23:14 < bhldev_> lol
23:15 < bhldev_> relative positioning, offsets, aspect ratio independent, etc.
23:24 < catid> we're basing it off other good examples :)
23:24 < catid> better schemes are more WYSIWYG, like storyboards on iOS
23:24 < catid> i'd love to have a drag-and-drop UI editor
23:40 < PierrickB> catid: Hi ! Maybe my question was not clear yesterday, about your plans. I was more thinking about planned upcoming features :)
23:43 < catid> oh
23:43 < catid> QR decoder/encoder is going in soon
--- Day changed Fri Jan 17 2014
00:17 < catid> it works on Android/iOS to produce base64-encoded PNGs you can display in place of the image URL
00:18 < catid> and you can also take photos and decode the photos to recover the text in the QR code
00:18 < catid> works with QR codes of URLs and things
00:36 < bhldev__> wysiwyg hrm
01:11 < PierrickB> Nice. So basic use of the phone's camera
01:21 < catid> yeah we already support the camera
01:22 < catid> another thing i want to add is the ability to display camera feed in real time for a QR scanning type app
01:22 < catid> it's in the works
04:02 < bhldev__> what do you think about component entity design pattern catid
06:52 < catid> never heard of it
06:52 < bhldev__> neither did I but someone recommended it for writing my own class hierarchy
06:53 < bhldev__> http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1f83c5/
06:59 < bhldev> anyway catid fyi I've gone back to java
06:59 < bhldev> lol
07:00 < bhldev> after a year of avoiding it I'm going back for many reasons
07:00 < catid> aww ok
07:00 < bhldev> well I'm keeping javascript around
07:00 < bhldev> don't worry
07:00 < bhldev> lol
07:00 < catid> oh yay
07:01 < bhldev> you do mostly c++?
07:01 < catid> yeah working on this project right now: https://github.com/catid/wirehair/
07:01 < catid> right now it has a 3% failure rate.. found a way to push that down to 0.001% and make it go faster this week, just need to write it
07:04 < bhldev> is 3% acceptable for udp lol
07:05 < catid> yeah it works out to about 26 bytes of overhead
07:05 < catid> or less.. depends on the size of the data
07:06 < catid> having better recovery rates makes it more applicable to file splitting-type apps
07:07 < catid> i've built it into a variable-length packet streaming library called Shorthair that essentially gives you a knob that lets you pick how much loss you want to experience over a wireless channel
07:07 < bhldev> that's pretty cool
07:07 < bhldev> now make it javascript and webrtc so I can use it
07:07 < bhldev> lol
07:07 < catid> heh
07:08 < catid> it will probably be part of the devkit eventually
07:09 < catid> i'm building a pretty cool network library based on a few things, want to hear more about it?
07:15 < bhldev> catid sure going to sleep soon tho
07:16 < catid> well briefly,
07:16 < catid> it uses a two byte header to identify connected clients to a server, so you can change IP addresses and keep sending data from the same connection
07:17 < catid> and also does a multihomed wifi + 3G connection trunk to fully use both channels
07:17 < catid> over that header it layers encryption, so the data is securely transported
07:17 < catid> within the encryption it runs a 5 byte header for error correction, so you can combat random packetloss over wireless channels
07:18 < catid> using shorthair/wirehair
07:18 < catid> and within the FEC layer it runs a transport layer that has several parallel streams of reliable-in-order data, reliable-out-of-order data, and unreliable data
07:18 < catid> all over UDP
07:19 < catid> with a fallback to TCP
07:19 < catid> the whole thing is written from the ground up in C++ using a lot of stuff i invented over the last few years
07:20 < bhldev> didn't know half that stuff was possible
07:20 < catid> and it provides the user of the library with a simple C style socket-style interface with a few extra parameters for username/password authentication
07:20 < bhldev> hope it catches on
07:21 < catid> it has a bunch of other bells/whistles like syn-cookie type stuff
07:21 < catid> but that's the gist of it
07:21 < bhldev> if you make it braindead simple like socket.io people will use it
07:21 < catid> yeah that's my goal
07:21 < catid> going to target mobile users mainly
07:22 < catid> and have plugins for e.g. Unity, ObjC, AndroidJava etc
07:22 < catid> best thing is, it's just a few months away from being done :D
07:23 < bhldev> very  interesting
07:24 < bhldev> will you have java too?
07:24 < bhldev> not sure how it would work in java
07:24 < catid> yeah i think Android's socket stuff is the same as normal desktop Java socket stuff
07:24 < catid> wouldn't be anything too special
07:24 < catid> on the server side i am just going to reuse libuv because they do things pretty well
07:25 < catid> a few years ago before libuv existed i was writing my own libuv-type thing
07:25 < catid> but that project was way too big for me and it died
07:25 < catid> this seems like just the right size project i can get it done
07:27 < bhldev> still seems quite large lol
07:27 < bhldev> you're supporting a lot of platforms
07:27 < catid> fortunately the majority of the code is portable C
07:27 < catid> it's just math code
07:27 < catid> i only have maybe 20 lines of assembly in the whole thing
07:27 < catid> with C fallbacks of course
07:28 < catid> it's also broken up into separate projects that i've been maintaining.. wirehair got me some contract work and it got a few improvements from that and some new stuff recently
07:29 < catid> the encryption stuff is all very new: https://github.com/catid/tabby/
07:29 < catid> just fixed a flaw in the protocol this morning
07:30 < catid> but it's pretty much wrapped up now
07:30 < catid> my buddy who owns RakNet is using it for encryption
07:30 < catid> will be in the next version
07:32 < bhldev> "your buddy who owns RakNet" lol
07:33 < bhldev> who else do you know ;p
07:33 < catid> i know the CEO of Game Closure ^_^;
07:33 < catid> iunno random people
07:33 < bhldev> if I had money and wanted fast to market
07:33 < bhldev> I might go evil and go microsoft and unity and use photon lol
07:34 < bhldev> that's the dream of all brogrammers, make a mmo with unity
07:34 < catid> yeah photon cloud is pretty cool
07:34 < catid> at some point i want to approach the devs of photon cloud and try to have then license my tech
07:35 < catid> what i want to do is sell this library as a commercial solution and try to get some big users like photon
07:35 < bhldev> oh not MIT?
07:35 < bhldev> btw know anything about 3d
07:35 < catid> no i'm pretty bad at 3d.. i've done a few 3d demos and read some intro books and looked at shader code
07:35 < bhldev> I started a blender course irl one of the reasons I'm starting java again and libgdx
07:36 < bhldev> ok
07:36 < catid> used lightwave when i was a kid :)
07:36 < bhldev> I was going to use babylon.js with a canvas accelerator too
07:36 < bhldev> it's fucking hard to find lgihtwave books
07:36 < bhldev> indigo and chapters don't seem tos tock them
07:36 < catid> yea now you can just use three.js lol
07:36 < catid> new world
07:37 < catid> i'm hoping to get a bunch of customers using the netcode library and attract a buyout from google or something like that
07:37 < catid> and i'd be a one-man shop with full ownership no VC
07:39 < catid> i don't understand startups these days
07:39 < catid> you shouldn't be able to go 3 years without actually selling anything
07:39 < catid> no business deals, no need to turn a profit
07:40 < catid> but still hiring like 20+ people
07:40 < catid> it just doesn't make sense
07:41 < catid> companies should be simple: you build something people want, and then you sell it.  and VCs should be there to take you from small scale to large scale operation
07:41 < catid> since when did it become "maybe one day i'll sell something, want to bet millions on it?"
07:45 < bhldev> well
07:46 < bhldev> only 1 in the 20 people will not be 9 to 5 or be excited enough
07:47 < bhldev> vcs work that way in the USA, failure almost assumed in Canada there is almost no tolerance for failure the market is too small
07:48 < bhldev> your startup bombing multiple times in the US seems to be a badge of honor
07:48 < bhldev> did you read my startup has 30 days to live
07:48 < bhldev> seems brutal
07:48 < catid> no didn't see that
07:50 < bhldev> lifestyle entrepreneur seems safer
07:55 < catid> nn
12:00 < scull> Hi everyone ! I'm trying to make my own android ad plugin to use admob in my games. But, I don't know how implement it : on admob sdk documentation, it said to include this java code : "setContentView(R.layout.main); LinearLayout layout = (LinearLayout)findViewById(R.id.mainLayout);layout.addView(adView);" But it doesn't works. I don't know  how to get the mainView ans the mainLayout. Have you got any idea ?
13:00 < scull> I've tried to follow this tutorial (AdMob on OpenGL ES), it's compile, but it doesn't works (the game is running, but no ads are display) : http://devblog.corpwar.net/2011/12/admob-with-opengl-es.html
13:07 < scull> anybody can help me ?

01:26 < PierrickB> Hey catid ! A quick question ; is there any way to get rid of GC cache ? We often have problems with 404 errors for assets which actually exists.
01:26 < PierrickB> exist*
11:58 < oodavid> is there a way to iterate over the "active" views in a viewPool?
11:59 < oodavid> Or even all the views for that matter, I can check the visibility
12:15 < oodavid> I see in timestep/ui/ViewPool.js I could access the internal property _views - I imagine using this will cause issues when compiled?
12:17 < oodavid> ...although... the adventuremap example accesses _views - I think I have a winner!
12:17 < oodavid> apologies for dumping :-)
16:29 < bhldev> I'm thinking of dumping half a year into opengl 2 catid what do you think
16:30 < bhldev> I can't really justify it, doesn't make sense with money and other options, only reason is if I don't learn programmable pipeline I'll feel like a faker lol
16:37 < bhldev> yeah just confirmed must know programmable pipeline to do graphics

17:30 < Godefroy> hi!
17:31 < Godefroy> do you know if GC handles circular dependencies correctly?
17:31 < Godefroy> I think I have an issue with that
18:05 < catid> good morning
18:05 < catid> we've iterated on that problem a couple times
18:05 < catid> it shows up again every now and then
18:05 < catid> so there's a chance something is still not ideal
18:06 < catid> i'm reasonably sure right now that normal View objects get garbage collected properly
18:06 < catid> but, it is easy to keep references to them by accident
18:06 < catid> the best way to deal with it, if you can, is to use view pools so you don't depend on GC
18:07 < catid> GC is a source of random latency anyway
18:07 < catid> so minimizing that is best
18:36 < oodavid> howdy all!
18:37 < catid> g'morning
18:45 < oodavid> Just popping on to say I had a most pleasurable weekend working with devkit
18:45 < oodavid> and to offer my thanks :-)
18:45 < catid> great!
18:45 < catid> i had a very good weekend *not* working on the devkit
18:46 < oodavid> pip pip!
18:46 < catid> looks like the QR code stuff is almost ready for release
18:46 < oodavid> the zxing addon?
18:46 < catid> dropped zxing - a friend pointed me at quirc, which is a lot faster and easier to integrate
18:47 < catid> the quirc developer responds via Email too
18:47 < oodavid> Never thought about it, I guess zxing has been around for a digital age
18:47 < oodavid> I'll look into quirc though, always useful
18:48 < catid> it may have some kind of limitation like only ASCII text etc
18:48 < catid> but i just want to encode short generated URLs so that works fine
18:49 < oodavid> code looks pretty tight
18:50 < oodavid> so is a lot of the work that goes into "integration" actually writing js emulators and documentation?
18:53 < catid> hm well for example, to get QR in I had to design how that will work first off
18:53 < catid> what JS API functions are needed, where to put them
18:54 < catid> what parameters are needed for a real application etc
18:54 < catid> then the implementation involved copying some old code I had lying around that does conversion to/from Base64
18:54 < catid> starting with zxing, ripping that out and going with quirc
18:55 < catid> had zxing working on iOS, then tried to get it working on Android and found it was a bear
18:55 < catid> writing a demo app that uses the feature so i can demo it at the company meetings
18:56 < catid> testing it under various conditions to see how large the QR code needs to be on the screen and what level of error correction coding to use
18:56 < oodavid> a lot of due diligence then!
18:57 < oodavid> do you have a lot of show and tell at company meetings?
18:57 < catid> i like to demo something every other week
18:57 < oodavid> always interested to know how companies like GC operate
18:57 < oodavid> ^that's an awesome way to keep momentum up
18:57 < catid> well last Friday it was all about my teammate and the CEO giving presentations on where we are going in the next few months
18:58 < catid> which was exciting to see
18:58 < catid> the week before that it was technical demos
18:59 < oodavid> sounds stimulating :-)
19:00 < oodavid> I am curious where you are headed, a while back you said you're working on a product full-time; am I right in assuming you also produce games anonymously for other companies?
19:00 < oodavid> there's a lot of mystique surrounding GC :D
19:02 < catid> sorry definitely can't talk about that stuff, but we will have something big to announce soon! :)
19:02 < oodavid> I've been reading too many detective novels :-)
19:03 < oodavid> But glad to hear!
19:03 < catid> i think the announcement happens either this week or next?
19:03 < oodavid> Ooooooh
19:04 < oodavid> I want GC merch

19:06 < catid> hrm, if you release a game on the devkit i'd certainly mail you something for contributing to the project.  seems fair
19:07 < oodavid> I'll hold you to that!
19:09 < oodavid> Don't suppose you know if my "animation" contributions will get pulled into devkit / timestep?
19:12 < oodavid> err, native-core and timestep rather
19:12 < oodavid> https://github.com/gameclosure/native-core/pull/2
19:13 < catid> lemme check
19:13 < catid> ah good
19:13 < catid> just inspecting to make sure the original functionality is still intact
19:15 < oodavid> I've a feeling there's more references to animation in other repos but not quite sure where to start, but happy to update the documentation
19:17 < catid> the existing stuff lgtm
19:17 < catid> will pull it in now
19:20 < oodavid> what a gent
19:24 < oodavid> Right then, I'm off to cook
19:24 < catid> later
19:24 < oodavid> might pop on tomorrow
19:24 < oodavid> good luck with that animation lark, don't sweat it if you want me to refactor etc.

14:11 < scull> Hi everyone !
14:11 < scull> I have a question about animation and especially rotations
14:12 < scull> When i make a rotation on a view, i set "anchorX" and "anchorY" value and i make the rotation
14:12 < scull> After this rotation, i want to translate the view
14:13 < scull> But before that, i want to "reset" the "r" value of the view (to rotate it again after the translation)
14:13 < scull> But, if i reset "anchorX", "anchorY" and "r" values, my view make a jump in the screen !
14:14 < scull> do you know a good method to reset rotation values of a view ?
14:20 < scull> So, i want to know if I can apply an operation to my view, and it keep X and Y position, but "anchorX", "anchorY" and "r" are equals to zero.
15:28 < scull> Sorry but i must quit, i post a question on google groop about my issue : https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/game-closure-devkit/ONiqtUkGhz8
15:28 < scull> Have a nice day !

22:51 < catid> ugh, Android sound loading is sooo slow
22:51 < catid> iOS is instantaneous..
23:10 < catid> aah
23:10 < catid> it's important to use OGG audio on android
23:10 < catid> otherwise it takes forever to load

18:32 -!- Athos is now known as Guest85350
18:32 < Guest85350> i had question involving style for textviews, is there a guide or creating a style object that all textviews can follow?
18:32 < Guest85350> similar to how you would handle it in android
18:37 < Guest85350> also within a textview is it possible to create new lines with <br> or something, that would be very useful to me

04:16 < debarko> catid, hey man how are you
21:18 < catid> hello
21:18 < catid> recently i've been fixing a bunch of android native issues
21:18 < catid> we also have a new spriter
21:18 < debarko_> wow.. awesome!! :)
21:20 < catid> i've noticed that the android builds have been freezing on homescreening
21:20 < catid> that was caused by several issues that are now addressed
21:21 < catid> also, when we detect out of memory conditions there is a weird "Oops!  There is something wrong" message, which sometimes shows up twice
21:21 < catid> that's new a much smoother flow so shouldn't confuse users
21:22 < catid> also, the accelerometer shake detection now supports older android devices that don't give accelerometer updates as frequently
21:22 < catid> and all of the plugins have had some kinds of improvements over the last few weeks
21:27 < catid> we've also been doing a lot more with browser builds lately
21:27 < catid> so those are much better supported now in the latest timestep code
21:27 < debarko_> catid, are they workin on IE?
21:27 < debarko_> browser builds?
21:27 < catid> i don't think that's been looked at
21:28 < debarko_> k.. if possible try visiting that part as well... :)
23:10 < PierrickB> catid: so, that was the problem with android ! I was wondering why builds were sometimes freezing (had to reload). Tks :)
23:10 < catid> will look into making a release later this week

02:28 < glaksmono> anyone is around?
17:41 < oodavid> glaksmono, I'm around!
17:41 < oodavid> I lurk 9-5 at UK time
17:45 < glaksmono> hi oodavid
17:45 < glaksmono> nice
17:46 < glaksmono> u still there?
17:46 < oodavid> indeed I am
17:46 < glaksmono> i'm looking at gameclosure as options to my engine :)
17:46 < glaksmono> may be i'll ping u when i have questions
17:46 < glaksmono> but it's looking good so far
17:46 < oodavid> ofcourse
17:46 < oodavid> well, I'm a hobbyist and spend maybe an hour a day / every other Sunday with it
17:47 < oodavid> it's been a very enjoyable experience
17:47 < oodavid> what sort of thing are you making?
18:01 < glaksmono> i'm trying to port my current game from craftyjs to use gameclosure
18:01 < glaksmono> sooo now i'm actually taking out my basil init to another folder
18:01 < glaksmono> and that doesn't seem to register the reference properly
18:03 < glaksmono> it's 404 now
18:03 < glaksmono> sigh
18:09 < glaksmono> oodavid,
18:27 < oodavid> Have you written it with MVC?
18:28 < oodavid> If so it should be a case of updating your Views to utilise the gameclosure Views
18:30 < catid> good morning
18:31 < catid> going to release a new devkit with the fixes i mentioned a few days ago, and also the back button in the simulator will trigger the back button event properly in games again
18:48 < glaksmono> hi, how do you repeat-x ?
18:48 < glaksmono> on a view?
18:48 < glaksmono> ImageView actually
18:50 < catid> i believe it works the same as the normal HTML5 repeat style
18:50 < catid> if that doesn't work then it's broken
18:50 < glaksmono> err, but i just have JavaSCript object
18:50 < catid> the style object is like CSS styles
18:52 < catid> ah i see
18:53 < catid> view.style.fillStyle = {"repeatPattern": "repeat-x"};
18:53 < catid> i think that works on native builds
18:53 < catid> maybe in the browser too
18:53 < glaksmono> catid, i tried this: https://gist.github.com/glaksmono/88e182836a5c49624ab9
18:53 < glaksmono> doesn't seem to be working
18:54 < glaksmono> i'm for the mobile browser build
18:54 < catid> try the fillStyle variation above
18:55 < glaksmono> hmm
18:55 < glaksmono> doesn't seem to work...
18:55 < catid> i think it needs to look like this: http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/tutorials/html5-canvas-patterns-tutorial/
18:56 < catid> on our context object we do have a createPattern function
18:59 < glaksmono> catid, i'm actually not sure what do u mean by "context object"
18:59 < glaksmono> sorry this is my first time using gameclosure
18:59 < glaksmono> i've just read some stuff about it
19:00 < catid> check out the Advanced Rendering example
19:01 < catid> basil install examples  if you don't have the examples yet
19:01 < catid> there's on for Tiles under Advanced Rendering, which shows how to get a context object and stuff like that
19:06 < glaksmono> catid, that seems to be a bit more complicated than i thought it should be..
19:06 < glaksmono> i don't really want to create "tiles" per-se..
19:06 < glaksmono> in DOM, usually we just do repeat-x
19:08 < catid> i see
19:08 < catid> it seems like those examples are for off-screen canvases
19:09 < catid> i mean if the game is never going to run on a native device then you could just bypass a lot of the devkit conventions
19:09 < catid> the main reason to stick to them is so that your game can be run as a native app
19:10 < glaksmono> hmm, what do you mean though?
19:10 < glaksmono> i'm just plnaning to compile these as browser-mobile
19:10 < catid> you don't want your app to run as a real app store or play store app right?
19:10 < catid> just in the mobile browser
19:11 < catid> the devkit is built to make it easier to write that kind of real app
19:11 < glaksmono> catid, well.. potentially may be.. but no plans yet for now
19:11 < catid> if you don't want to do that then it would probably be better to use a toolkit designed for web browsers
19:11 < glaksmono> soooo... what is this "toolkit" that you're talking about?
19:11 < glaksmono> is it part of the gameclosure?
19:12 < catid> ie. something that isn't GC devkit
19:12 < catid> there are lots of HTML5 game development kits
19:12 < catid> this one is designed mainly for native apps
19:13 < glaksmono> i see
19:13 < catid> here: http://mobilegameengines.com/html5/2d_game_engines
19:13 < glaksmono> got what u meant..
19:13 < glaksmono> well i guess then, sure, we may be planning to port this into iOS
19:14 < glaksmono> and android
19:14 < glaksmono> but not anytime soon.. i think gameclosure is pretty good mediator between all platforms, that's why i picked it
19:16 < catid> i know we've done repeating backgrounds before to hack some HTML5 games to run on it
19:16 < catid> lemme find the blog post..
19:16 < catid> it was this one: http://www.gameclosure.com/blog/2013/03/space-blaster-meets-mobile
19:18 < glaksmono> hmmm catid
19:18 < glaksmono> the thing is that this example uses the whole canvas and repeating the element within the canvas right?
19:18 < catid> yeah
19:18 < glaksmono> for me... i wanted to have like multiple repeating elements on the top of canvas
19:19 < glaksmono> so imagine like... 1 background.. cover
19:19 < catid> like the cicada principle?
19:19 < glaksmono> then on the top of that background, i want to repeat... buildings
19:20 < glaksmono> yeah, pretty much
19:20 < glaksmono> so basically.. you have different layers with different repeating element
19:20 < glaksmono> z at 5 could be repeat y
19:20 < catid> well it does support transparencies in your images
19:20 < glaksmono> and z at 3 could be repeat x
19:20 < catid> so you can layer things
19:21 < catid> but you should know that on native platforms it would be very slow to redraw the whole screen several times over
19:21 < glaksmono> hmmm so what is your suggestion?
19:21 < catid> it would be much more efficient to render this background to an off-screen canvas once and then render the canvas each frame
19:21 < glaksmono> so i wanted to draw buildings repeated on x direction
19:21 < glaksmono> how would you do it?
19:22 < glaksmono> hmmm.. but it doesn't move does it?
19:22 < catid> are you doing a parallax effect?
19:22 < glaksmono> yes
19:22 < glaksmono> parallax.. is like.. that should be moving right?
19:22 < catid> we do have a runner demo with parallax background
19:22 < glaksmono> so it's like.. building, and then it moves toward x direction
19:23 < catid> the foreground moves faster than the background = parallax
19:24 < catid> under devkit/projects/platformer
19:25 < catid> that example is also good because it has a good introduction to view pools which is important to make your game run smoothly
19:28 < glaksmono> catid, this is interesting..
19:28 < glaksmono> i see that the width of the image and the actual width that's defined is the same
19:28 < glaksmono> i'mw ondering on how does it handle retina vs. non-retina?
19:29 < catid> everything should be scaled to look the same overall
19:29 < catid> on a screen with more pixels ("retina") it will just have more detail or cleaner lines
19:30 < glaksmono> interesting..
19:30 < glaksmono> it renders it pretty well on the simulator
19:30 < glaksmono> so all images are suppose to be on retina size right?
19:30 < glaksmono> and then the engine will handle for the smaller devices?
19:30 < catid> images should fit within 1024x1024 spritesheets
19:30 < catid> spriting is done for you
19:30 < glaksmono> cool
19:30 < glaksmono> let me play around then
19:30 < glaksmono> thank you so much catid
19:30 < glaksmono> are you contributor ?
19:31 < catid> yea
19:31 < glaksmono> nice
19:31 < glaksmono> cooll
19:37 < glaksmono> catid,
19:37 < glaksmono> sooo.. the width should always be 1024?
19:37 < glaksmono> if i want it to always take the full screen?
19:38 < catid> no each image should have dimensions under 1024x1024 so that it can be displayed on mobile native apps
19:38 < catid> typical images are 32x32 pixels or so
19:38 < catid> OpenGL ES does not support larger than 1024x1024 textures
19:38 < glaksmono> soo, i noticed that on paralax example... all of the fargroundBrushes are 1024 width..
19:38 < catid> how things fit to the screen is entirely up to you, you can scale or whatnot
19:38 < glaksmono> i think that way it could be displayed as the background,, right?
19:39 < catid> there are no special sizes
19:39 < catid> it's all just views with textures on them
19:39 < catid> you can fit them to the screen to make them into backgrounds
19:39 < glaksmono> yes, but i guess if it's smaller than 1024, then u have to scale up.. and that may distort the image
19:39 < catid> yes
19:39 < catid> larger is usually better for backgrounds
19:40 < glaksmono> cool that makes sense
19:40 < catid> also, phones are not square in screen dimension
19:40 < catid> so you probably want one dimension of your backgrounds to be larger than the other
19:41 < catid> our game backgrounds for a portrait-oriented game are 578x1024
19:41 < catid> and we cut off the top/bottom to fit it fully to the screen
19:42 < glaksmono> hmmm but why would it be 578 width?
19:42 < glaksmono> sooo my case for example... 697???530
19:42 < glaksmono> but on Nexus 5
19:43 < catid> that works for the most narrow phones out there
19:43 < glaksmono> then that's not enough width
19:43 < glaksmono> ah yeah
19:43 < glaksmono> but that will break on nexus right?
19:43 < catid> why?
19:43 < glaksmono> Galaxy Nexus.. 720 x 1184
19:43 < catid> step 1. scale background to fit screen horizontally
19:44 < glaksmono> ohhh i see
19:44 < glaksmono> so u scaled it
19:44 < glaksmono> but then it's not gonna be that sharp
19:44 < glaksmono> ok ok
19:44 < glaksmono> i got it..
19:44 < glaksmono> so u scaled it for larger devices
19:44 < catid> well it can't be any bigger :)
19:44 < catid> we could have multiple textures for the background but seems like more hassle than it's worth and it looks great
19:45 < glaksmono> got it..
19:54 < glaksmono> catid, sooo... i'm now trying to understand on how does it setup the avatarKiwiAce
19:54 < glaksmono> i'm getting this error
19:54 < glaksmono> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'frames' of undefined
19:54 < glaksmono> thoughts?
19:54 < glaksmono> i just have 2 images..
19:54 < glaksmono> and i set it up like...
19:54 < glaksmono> images/baby
19:54 < catid> probably there is a variable named frames
19:54 < glaksmono> images/baby/baby_run_0001.png
19:55 < catid> and you need to set it to something before using it
19:55 < catid> oh the object that it should be in is not set to a real object
19:55 < glaksmono> eh?
19:55 < catid> you have something like this: x.y = 1;
19:55 < catid> but x = {};
19:55 < catid> err
19:55 < catid> x = undefined
19:56 < catid> you need to set the x to something before using a property of it in JavaScript
19:56 < catid> that's what that error means
19:57 < glaksmono> well the error is actually coming frmo the engine though..
19:57 < glaksmono> i'm just trying to set it up the same way as the one that platformer had
19:57 < glaksmono> but i just changed the image
19:57 < glaksmono> and it broke
19:58 < glaksmono> not sure what i'm missing here
19:58 < glaksmono> well i'm assuming i'm not sure where does it know to go from frame 1 to frame 2
19:58 < catid> trying out the platformer..
19:58 < catid> seems to work OK
19:59 < glaksmono> ah i got it
19:59 < glaksmono> hmmm ok
19:59 < glaksmono> now i'm not seeing the image tho
19:59 < glaksmono> let me see
21:50 < glaksmono> catid, u there?
21:50 < catid> yes
21:51 < glaksmono> catid, any ideas what caused the platformer example not accepting the second subsequent tab?
21:51 < glaksmono> i want it so that on each tap, it pushes the thing upward
21:51 < catid> i think the code right now only allows you to super-jump once
21:51 < catid> you could find that code and eliminate the check
21:52 < glaksmono> oh i think i see it
22:47 < glaksmono> catid, u there?
22:47 < catid> yes
22:47 < glaksmono> nice :D
22:47 < glaksmono> sooo
22:47 < glaksmono> i have a problem that i wanted to repeat-y
22:47 < glaksmono> :-/
22:47 < glaksmono> how do i do that?
22:48 < glaksmono> repeat y
22:48 < glaksmono> right now i can have the sreen moves
22:48 < glaksmono> i wanted to create something that's repeat-y
22:48 < glaksmono> basically like a wall
22:48 < glaksmono> https://gist.github.com/glaksmono/88e182836a5c49624ab9
22:48 < glaksmono> scaling the style.. would actually destort it
22:48 < catid> it looks like the repeat[-x][-y] stuff is supported in some way
22:48 < catid> i see it in our context2d
22:49 < catid> and it was working at one point
22:49 < glaksmono> i tried to use backgroundRepeat, doesn't seem to be working
22:49 < glaksmono> so basically i need to set height = 500
22:49 < glaksmono> and then.. repeat-y
22:49 < glaksmono> thoughts?
22:50 < catid> it looks like you have to use ctx.fillRect() to make use of it though
22:50 < catid> rather than allowing the normal timestep rendering to render it for you
22:50 < glaksmono> ugh
22:50 < glaksmono> how do i do that?
22:50 < glaksmono> any examples?
22:50 < catid> well that blog post i pointed you at does but it also does a lot of other things
22:51 < glaksmono> hmmm
22:51 < catid> could you just create a bunch of views?
22:51 < catid> and tile them down the screen
22:51 < glaksmono> ahhh
22:51 < glaksmono> that's right
22:51 < glaksmono> that would work easier
22:51 < glaksmono> hmm
23:27 < glaksmono> hi catid
23:27 < catid> hello
23:27 < glaksmono> sooo.. currently when i tap, it could fly really high..
23:27 < glaksmono> how do you disable that?
23:27 < glaksmono> as in the screen actually moves with the y
23:27 < catid> you could edit the JavaScript code
23:28 < glaksmono> which part is that?
23:28 < catid> i would need to look at the code
23:29 < glaksmono> or may be what's the term of it?
23:29 < glaksmono> so that i could search
23:29 < catid> sorry no idea
23:30 < glaksmono> ah i think i know
23:30 < glaksmono> scrollTo
23:30 < glaksmono> hmm
23:30 < glaksmono> thanks :)
23:56 < glaksmono> hey catid, it seems like it's being rendered much much bigger on the actual android devices.. i think that's cuz they don't support retina, how do people usually handle this?
23:56 < glaksmono> do i need to manually divide the width and the height?
23:56 < glaksmono> i'm assuming
23:56 < glaksmono> it looks fine on the simulator tho
23:57 < catid> i think the physical dimensions are in device.width and device.height if you import device;
23:57 < catid> so when you set the size/position of a view, it is from 0..width and 0..height
23:58 < catid> view.style.x = 0 would put it on the left
23:58 < catid> view.style.x = device.width - 100; would offset it 100 pixels from the right
23:58 < catid> if you want to scale things to fit to the screen, there are some shortcuts in the layout system
23:59 < catid> but those are best used for menu systems
23:59 < catid> and it's faster to just scale things with math
23:59 < glaksmono> i believe i need to get the deviceToPixel ratio
23:59 < catid> don't think so..
23:59 < glaksmono> hmmm..
--- Day changed Sat Feb 01 2014
00:00 < catid> in our production games on the stores, we only use device.width and device.height to scale everything
00:01 < glaksmono> hmmm... soooo
00:02 < glaksmono> so our assets are made for the retina pixels..
00:02 < glaksmono> i need a logic where it's like..
00:02 < glaksmono> if devicetoPixel ratio is 2, then let it stay the same
00:02 < glaksmono> otherwise, divide it by 2
00:02 < glaksmono> the style.width and style.height
00:03 < catid> here's some code to help you:
00:03 < catid> https://gist.github.com/chris-gc/8745857
00:03 < catid> we use this to scale our views across different device resolutions for our portait-mode games
00:04 < catid> this way, you can design for virtual pixels where the screen is always "576 pixels" wide
00:04 < catid> and multiply positions/sizes by scaling factors to place on the screen correctly
00:06 < glaksmono> catid, sooo... that doesn't seem to work..
00:06 < glaksmono> i just tested it..
00:06 < catid> well it's not something you can just copy/paste
00:07 < catid> it's just a way to show you how it should be done
00:19 < glaksmono_> catid, i guess i still haven't grasp the concept of how you're approaching the retina vs. non-retina support..
00:19 < glaksmono_> usually in DOM we just divide the height and width by 2
00:19 < glaksmono_> i tried the devicePixelRatio, it doesn't seem to be working.. for some reason
00:19 < glaksmono_> it only works on simulator
00:19 < glaksmono_> but not on actual phone
00:20 < catid> on a retina iPad we scale things in the native code to work the same as a non-retina iPad
00:20 < catid> so you don't need to know that stuff in your game code
00:20 < catid> i'm not sure if mobile browser on a retina device are working
00:21 < catid> but you can test on a normal device in the simulator and it will run the same on any real device
00:22 < glaksmono_> ah yeah
00:22 < glaksmono_> this is on mobile browser that i'm testing..
00:22 < glaksmono_> not native..
00:23 < catid> hrm, well i spend all day making sure the native iOS/Android builds of our games work properly so i have no experience with the mobile browser builds
00:24 < catid> i know the devicePixelRatio is exposed to you, so you can grab it and scale your stuff appropriately
00:24 < catid> because it's in a browser all the normal browser features are there
00:27 < glaksmono_> yeah, but it doesn't seem to detect it correctly on nexus phone seems like
00:58 < glaksmono_> catid, how do you change the width and height of SpriteView ?
00:58 < glaksmono_> i'mt rying to divide the width and height by 2
00:58 < glaksmono_> thid doesn't seem to work
00:58 < catid> view.style.width and view.style.height
00:58 < glaksmono_> this.player.style.width = this.player.style.width / 2;
00:58 < glaksmono_> hmm
00:58 < glaksmono_> that doesn't work..
00:59 < glaksmono_> looked like this: https://gist.github.com/glaksmono/9930f8416580811f90f1
01:00 < glaksmono_> ideas catid ?
01:01 < catid> looks OK to me
01:01 < catid> have JS errors in the console?
01:01 < catid> maybe the image cannot be found or something
01:03 < glaksmono_> no error :-/ catid
01:03 < glaksmono_> not scaling on simulator as well
01:06 < glaksmono_> what is autoSize?
01:06 < glaksmono_> when i removed that, it's just gone..
01:06 < glaksmono_> it wouldn't even render
01:06 < catid> you need to set a width/height if that isn't set
01:09 < glaksmono_> still doesn't scale it
01:09 < catid> oh yeah that explains why width/height was doing nothing perhaps
01:09 < catid> if autoScale is true it may ignore those
01:11 < catid> jimmy says the width/height can be changed on a spriteview to scale them
01:11 < catid> so that should be working
01:22 < glaksmono_> ah yea
01:22 < glaksmono_> that's right
01:22 < glaksmono_> it works
01:22 < glaksmono_> thanks catid
01:22 < glaksmono_> :)
01:23 < glaksmono_> but now i have the problem where the sizes are too small for retina phones
01:23 < glaksmono_> hmmmmm
01:23 < glaksmono_> cuz i divide everything by 2
01:23 < glaksmono_> but it looks perfect on android phone
01:40 < catid> you can check device.isAndroid i think
01:41 < catid> or whatever makes sense there
01:42 < glaksmono_> errr
01:42 < glaksmono_> not seeing that actually
01:44 < glaksmono_> http://screencast.com/t/i4NTjDIA
01:45 < catid> well, it's undefined :)
01:45 < catid> you can still do if (device.isAndroid)
01:45 < catid> however that's only for native builds
01:45 < glaksmono_> snap
01:45 < glaksmono_> yeah, then that only works on native build i think
01:46 < glaksmono_> i'm on browser..
01:53 < catid> heading out pretty soon
01:53 < glaksmono_> hmmm... thought of good idea on how to get around this catid ?
01:53 < glaksmono_> seems like u know more on native instead of browser eh?
01:53 < catid> no i'm not sure what the problem is
01:54 < glaksmono_> soo basically.. our assets are intended for retina phones..
01:54 < glaksmono_> that means if it's displayed on non-retina phones, then it'd be too big
01:54 < catid> i'm not sure what you mean by retina
01:54 < glaksmono_> so i have to divide all of the views by 2
01:54 < catid> retina is an apple marketing gimmick
01:54 < catid> images for these games should be under 1024x1024 in size
01:55 < glaksmono_> hmm ok
01:55 < catid> and you should fix the screen width at 576 pixels and scale everything to that
01:55 < glaksmono_> why 576?
01:55 < catid> (or height for landscape games)
01:55 < catid> it's just a good realistic number to use based on 1024 pixel limits
01:56 < glaksmono_> wait sooo
01:56 < glaksmono_> this code that you gave me
01:56 < glaksmono_> that means... all phones are going to have that size?
01:56 < glaksmono_> 576 width?
01:56 < glaksmono_> is that what it's doing?
01:56 < glaksmono_> i guess i don't really understand your code..
01:56 < glaksmono_> https://gist.github.com/chris-gc/8745857
01:56 < catid> it is calculating scaling factors
01:56 < glaksmono_> i tried that it doesn't seem to do anything
01:56 < catid> you need to understand the math
01:56 < glaksmono_> not sure about the content_ratio and BG_ratio
01:57 < glaksmono_> ABS_RATIO is aspectratio i think?
01:57 < catid> the idea is to treat every screen as having the same width
01:57 < glaksmono_> ah ok
01:57 < glaksmono_> cool
01:57 < catid> so that the game looks roughly the same
01:57 < glaksmono_> soooo..
01:57 < catid> all your fixed values can then assume 576 pixel screens
01:57 < glaksmono_> after we have your code, what else do i need to do?
01:57 < catid> but when you add view styles you need to scale to the real screen size
01:57 < glaksmono_> i only support portrait, not landscape
01:57 < catid> good that works with the gist
01:58 < glaksmono_> yeah, sooo.. i can copy and paste your code right?
01:58 < catid> yeah you can put it in a config.js file
01:58 < glaksmono_> then i'm not sure what do you mean by "scale to the real screen size"
01:58 < catid> then import config; to bring it in
01:58 < catid> and config.BLAH to access the calculations
01:58 < catid> well you want to pretend the screen is 576 pixels wide
01:59 < catid> and you want to place an object at 10,20 on the virtual screen
01:59 < catid> then you do view.style.x = 10 * config.SCALE_WHATEVER;
01:59 < catid> to get the actual pixels for the device it is on
01:59 < catid> but this way you can position things easily
02:00 < catid> and it will look consistent
02:00 < glaksmono_> hmmm
02:00 < glaksmono_> scaling the x and y as well?
02:00 < glaksmono_> not the width and height?
02:00 < catid> yea
02:00 < catid> anything related to pixels
02:00 < catid> then you can decide if you want to clip the top or the bottom or both
02:00 < catid> so on a wide iPad it is heavily clipped
02:01 < catid> and on a slip Nexus 5 it is not clipped
02:01 < catid> slim*
02:01 < glaksmono_> ok sooo.. can you give an example
02:01 < glaksmono_> let's say i have view
02:01 < glaksmono_> size 100x100
02:01 < glaksmono_> i scale that 100 with exports.FULL_SCREEN_WIDTH ?
02:01 < catid> i'm not sure what those scaling factors actually are in the file
02:01 < catid> and i'm not sure if you need to do anything extra for mobile browsers
02:02 < catid> this is just what i'm seeing our gamedevs do
02:02 < catid> you'll have to work through the math to see if it makes sense for you
02:03 < glaksmono_> ah i see..
02:03 < glaksmono_> i guess yeah, i don't really understand how does the math makes sense..
02:03 < glaksmono_> or at least i'm not seeing it
02:03 < glaksmono_> i just see that at least there are 3 things that we can use here
02:03 < glaksmono_> exports.FULL_SCREEN_WIDTH, exports.FULL_SCREEN_HEIGHT, and exports.FULL_SCREEN_SCALE

17:38 < glaksmono> anyone is around?
17:38 < glaksmono> catid, u there?
17:46 < glaksmono> https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/game-closure-devkit/yZ49qeoPRWw <--- still trying to figure :-/
17:46 < glaksmono> i guess more precisely on implementation level..
18:12 < PierrickB> catid: seems weird that in the "Internationalization" tab the linked example is off topic : http://doc.gameclosure.com/example/images-cover-contain/
18:25 < glaksmono> it's really interesting by looking at the platformer example.. all of the sizes are on its real size and it's sharp on retina display..
18:25 < glaksmono> wondering how does gameclosure did the "magic"
18:27 < catid> PierrickB: added that to my TODO list
18:27 < catid> glaksmono: scaling is done for you on native platforms
18:28 < catid> glaksmono: you only need to know pixel size of the screen as reported by device.width and device.height
18:28 < catid> and fix your images to the screen based on those
18:53 < glaksmono> catid,
18:53 < glaksmono> i just changed the asset .png to the half size by replacing it, and for some reason it's blinking.. thoughts?
18:53 < glaksmono> it worked fine on my bigger assets
18:54 < catid> if the graphic is part of an animation,
18:54 < catid> then perhaps the size also needs to be adjusted elsewhere in the code
18:54 < glaksmono> yes it's animation..
18:55 < glaksmono> not seeing where i actually set the width and height..
18:57 < catid> here are the docs and examples for imageview animations: http://docs.gameclosure.com/api/ui-images.html#class-ui.imageview
19:05 -!- ServerMode/#gameclosure [+o ChanServ] by kornbluth.freenode.net
21:01 < glaksmono> catid, for some reason if it's on the android webview.. it thinks that the device width and height much smaller than what it should be..
21:02 < glaksmono> but if it's on chrome browser of the android device, the width and height of the device is detected properly..
21:02 < glaksmono> thoughts?
21:06 -!- octarine_ is now known as octarine
21:08 < catid> no idea
21:08 < catid> i've never done anything with mobile browsers personally
21:09 < catid> the CTO is all about mobile browsers and has spent a lot of time on these problems, but he's not in today
21:10 < catid> i'll ask around hold on a sec
21:16 < glaksmono> catid, the way i'm hacking it:
21:16 < glaksmono> https://gist.github.com/glaksmono/15e59b778f687a45490e
21:17 < glaksmono> i'm not sure what's the diff between the screen and device.screen
21:17 < glaksmono> but there's def something messed up there
21:17 < glaksmono> but with that hack, it's pixelated on android web view
21:18 < catid> sorry no one is here with browser experience right now :-/
21:19 < catid> your best bet might be to google around for normal ways to detect these things
21:52 < glaksmono> catid, http://docs.gameclosure.com/guide/scaling.html
21:52 < glaksmono> solved my issue
21:52 < catid> oh good
21:52 < glaksmono> really intersting
21:52 < glaksmono> so the idea is that we're using that 576 x 1024..
21:52 < glaksmono> and then scale it based on that right?
21:53 < glaksmono> so in case of iphone 5... that size is scaled up to 1136 x 640
21:53 < glaksmono> heh
21:53 < catid> yea i tried to explain this last time we talked, but i'm not so great at explaining :)
21:53 < catid> the docs are better refs sometimes
21:53 < glaksmono> haha, u were good
21:53 < glaksmono> thanks a lot for helping out all these time :)
21:54 < glaksmono> and btw the code there it has a minor bug..
21:54 < glaksmono> var baseWidth = bounds_width;
21:54 < glaksmono> it uses wrong var name
21:54 < glaksmono> should be boundsWidth
21:55 < catid> i see
22:02 < catid> pushed a fix for that, should be reflected on the website next release
22:11 < glaksmono> (y)
22:22 < glaksmono> hey catid
22:22 < glaksmono> if i don't want to use link instead..
22:23 < glaksmono> lrwxr-xr-x  1 glaksmono  staff   37 Jan 30 18:20 sdk -> /Users/glaksmono/Documents/devkit/sdk
22:23 < glaksmono> lrwxr-xr-x  1 glaksmono  staff   37 Jan 30 18:20 sdk -> /Users/glaksmono/Documents/devkit/sdk
22:23 < glaksmono> for the sdk reference: lrwxr-xr-x  1 glaksmono  staff   37 Jan 30 18:20 sdk -> /Users/glaksmono/Documents/devkit/sdk
22:23 < glaksmono> how do i do that?
22:23 < glaksmono> i tried to remove that and paste "sdk"
22:23 < glaksmono> didn't seem to work
22:23 < glaksmono> thoughts?
22:23 < catid> i'm confused
22:24 < catid> when you run the basil build command i believe it regenerates that symlink for you
22:24 < glaksmono> exactly
22:24 < glaksmono> how do i make it "not symblink"
22:24 < glaksmono> that way i can check that on its own folder
22:24 < glaksmono> and ic an deploy it ?
22:25 < catid> are you asking how to deliver the final code without the symlink?
22:25 < glaksmono> yes
22:25 < catid> you can just delete it
22:25 < glaksmono> and then copy and paste src?
22:25 < catid> when someone else builds it it will add that symlink on their PC
22:25 < glaksmono> hmm
22:25 < glaksmono> how to "builds" it?
22:26 < glaksmono> i want to deploy this on heroku..
22:26 < catid> basil debug browser-mobile --clean
22:26 < glaksmono> hmm
22:26 < catid> copies the app into build/debug/browser-mobile
22:26 < catid> there are docs about building on the site
22:27 < glaksmono> link?
22:29 < catid> the best build docs are here: http://docs.gameclosure.com/native.html
22:29 < glaksmono> err but that's for native
22:29 < glaksmono> not for mobile web
22:29 < glaksmono> :-/
22:31 < catid> we don't have any docs for building for mobile browsers
22:32 < catid> but it's not complex
22:32 < catid> just do basil build and see the options
22:47 < glaksmono> basically my problem now is that i wanted to integrate gameclosure into a rails app..
22:47 < glaksmono> and it seems like there's not really a straightforward way to do that
22:57 < glaksmono> anyone had experience integrating gameclosure and rails?
22:57 < glaksmono> hmmm
22:58 < catid> you could run the GC code in an iframe
22:58 < glaksmono> eh?
22:58 < glaksmono> what do u mean?
22:58 < catid> store the game code on your web server
22:58 < catid> write an iframe into the HTML code in the browser with source set to the game code location
22:59 < catid> it will display within the iframe
22:59 < glaksmono> hmmm but displaying within iframe isn't very good isn't it?
22:59 < glaksmono> so the gamecanvas is within iframe?
22:59 < glaksmono> hmmm
22:59 < catid> i don't see the disadvantage
23:00 < catid> you want the game to talk to your other JavaScript outside the game?
23:00 < glaksmono> probably not
23:00 < glaksmono> all of th eUI should be within the ganme
23:00 < glaksmono> but rails will also host the web services..
23:02 < glaksmono> don't think it's that simple actually
23:02 < glaksmono> rails got assets pipeline..
23:02 < glaksmono> and to deploy this gc
23:03 < glaksmono> i need to build first..
23:03 < glaksmono> and then deploy the build/browser-mobile
23:03 < glaksmono> that's the client..
23:03 < glaksmono> no one experienced with rails deployment?
23:05 < catid> mm no sorry
23:29 < glaksmono> catid, is there a way to include gameclosure as library instead of the whole set with emulator etc?
23:29 < glaksmono> when i said library, it's just some js that i can include...
23:30 < catid> i don't think so because of the import syntax of js.io
23:30 < catid> your game code must be compiled before running

00:32 < bhldev> but it doesn't work for what I want to do I want to make data driven game with scripting, nothing else but javascript works
00:32 < bhldev> was thinking of 3d and box2d and other things
00:35 < catid> i'm a fan of luajit
00:36 < catid> so if you had a lot of time or developers working with you, building something with that would be ideal
00:36 < catid> JavaScript has better tooling for fast projects tho
00:52 < bhldev> I thought about lua
00:53 < bhldev> I am too impatient to spend another half a year mastering another language though
00:54 < bhldev> and how would I use it
00:54 < bhldev> compile it to llvm then use emscripten? lol
00:54 < catid> i'm still mastering C after over a decade
00:54 < bhldev> emscripten solves all problems
00:55 < catid> found out today that signed integer overflows are undefined behavior
00:55 < bhldev> okay not master but know enough to make money off it
00:55 < catid> and can cause weird optimization bugs
00:55 < bhldev> yeah javascript is it
00:56 < bhldev> and afaik gc is the only thing low level enough and without a predefined workflow so I can create my own
00:57 < catid> cool to see we have a niche :)
01:03 < bhldev> if I ever make it I'll release it
01:04 < bhldev> after I make some $ off it of course
01:04 < bhldev> lol
01:14 < bhldev> actually I made the decision after dealing with totally unrelated problems
01:14 < bhldev> my work is totally unrelated but we're trying to automate and the conclusion was without scripting we could never deal with edge or border cases, it's the same with everything
01:15 < bhldev> like grunt or jake or build systems must be able to script the task there's no way you can anticipate everything
01:19 < catid> interesting
01:19 < catid> i guess we're using nodejs to run our build scripts
01:22 < bhldev> yeah that's what I'm using too
01:25 < bhldev> but not just build, more interested in making data driven games or projects
01:32 < catid> it sounds like you are working on a lot of different types of projects
01:54 < bhldev> even eval works
01:54 < bhldev> an awful use case would be, load a script and eval it... would only do that as last resort but it's there if I need it
08:51 < bhldev> heh catid not so much a niche after all
08:51 < bhldev> people have embedded lua with java and other things
09:04 < bhldev> still it's not exactly the same thing, it's not like dynamically eval java code at runtime
09:04 < bhldev> the niche is still there someone just has to build a front layer for it
17:28 < oodavid> Trying to install the testapp on android, but getting an undecipherable error

18:30 < oodavid> Installed Android 4.0 (API 14) and Android 2.2 (API 8) and still getting the same issue

19:33 < oodavid> had to install ant, fix my $JAVA_PATH and add the linux platform-tools to my $PATH for adb and now I'm up and running!
20:47 < oodavid> Splendid!
20:48 < oodavid> Just deployed a debug version onto my android phone, works pretty much as expected
20:48 < oodavid> well, apart from the animation features that catid pulled into the latest build
22:31 < catid> great
22:31 < catid> i could do a release of the devkit today
22:31 < catid> lemme just do some more regression testing and make sure nothing experimental is in there

01:28 < oodavid> Does "basil build native-android" apply zipalign or is that something I'd need to do manually?
01:30 < catid> yeah it does that for you
01:49 < catid> there's a new devkit version 0.1.45
01:49 < catid> please let me know if that isn't working for you :)
02:02 < oodavid> ding dong, I'll give that a go now
02:02 < oodavid> While you're here; is there a View property that says "modifying the width and height will SCALE the view" ?
02:03 < oodavid> or a rig that will do that...
02:18 < oodavid> catid, did that release include the native-core pull request? Mine's reverted to a the original version...
02:18 < oodavid> might have been an issue with basil update that I missed
18:17 < catid> oodavid: hrm the release did include your pull request but i think we had to fix some things
18:17 < catid> because you have your own version of it you may need to erase your repo to get the update feature to work
19:07 < oodavid> Morning
19:07 < catid> hiya
19:07 < oodavid> I suspected as much, so I stashed my changes and tried to run basil update again
19:08 < oodavid> which worked for timestep but not native-core
19:08 < catid> hum
19:08 < oodavid> I'll just grab the branch I'm on
19:08 < catid> what's the error?
19:08 < oodavid> HEAD detached at c4434ff
19:09 < oodavid> there is no error
19:09 < catid> huh
19:09 < oodavid> before I jump the gun, I'll re-run update
19:09 < oodavid> brb
19:45 < oodavid> http://pastebin.com/diSNvWT0
19:47 < oodavid> it all looks OK, but there's no reference to native-core so I'm assuming it's just not echoe'd for some reason
19:57 < oodavid> the commit I'm on is the 9th Dec
19:59 < oodavid> Gonna have a dig around and see where I can get the release branches; the addons directory isn't a submodule so I'm guessing it's a subtree or something else altogether :-)
20:00 < oodavid> as an aside, I dig the new simulator interface
20:06 < oodavid> aha, so devkit pulls core addons with the same tag - it would appear this is where the issue lies (for me)
20:07 < oodavid> I'm guessing that since devkit is successfully on "release-0.1.45" that it's assuming addons are up-to-date
20:07 < oodavid> I'll see if I can roll back and then update again
20:11 < catid> the addons directory is curated by our scripts
20:11 < catid> when you do basil install billing or whatnot
20:11 < catid> deleting the addons might be a good idea
20:12 < catid> our addons can't touch npm.  lots of stuff can be improved
20:15 < oodavid> so if I just delete the entire addons/native-android directory yeah?
20:16 < oodavid> yup
20:16 < oodavid> that did it
20:16 < oodavid> cheers catid :-)
20:17 < oodavid> in return I will update your docs re: the animation library
20:58 < catid> thanks
22:19 < glaksmono> anyone is around?

23:11 < glaksmono> can you help me with this.. platformer example? https://gist.github.com/glaksmono/15e59b778f687a45490e
23:11 < glaksmono> for some reason.. animation doesn't work.. on the later case
23:11 < glaksmono> not sure why would that be :-/
23:11 < glaksmono> something to do with that.. if (this.player.getPrevBottom() <= hit.view.getTop() + 10 && this.player.velocity.y >= 0) {
23:11 < glaksmono> what does that mean..
23:32 < oodavid> not sure TBH, I've not read through the platformer code before
23:34 < glaksmono> well.. what i wanted to do is basically..
23:34 < glaksmono> on collision.. i wanted to start animationFrame
23:34 < glaksmono> it doesn't seem to do the job
23:34 < glaksmono> :-/
23:34 < glaksmono> not sure what i'm missing
23:34 < glaksmono> the first one works though
23:34 < glaksmono> any thoughts on the code?
23:55 < glaksmono> can anyone help me pleaseee? :(

00:28 < oodavid> I don't know
02:39 < glaksmono> anyon is around?
02:39 < glaksmono> do you know how to bind the action button on TextDialogView ???
02:39 < glaksmono> i can't find docs for that
03:19 < bhldev> heh where's catid
03:20 < bhldev> is it possible to use typescript or coffeescript or anything else with gc?
03:20 < bhldev> I don't see why not
03:27 < glaksmono> man, its so hard to setup dialog
03:27 < glaksmono> my dialog is all messed up
03:27 < bhldev> the textviewprompt?
03:27 < glaksmono> yeah
03:27 < glaksmono> and there's no docs
03:28 < bhldev> 9 slice?
03:28 < glaksmono> eh?
03:28 < glaksmono> where did it specify that?
03:28 < glaksmono> iu don't see that on the sample code
03:30 < glaksmono> something with my background is messed up
03:30 < glaksmono> ideas?

03:36 < bhldev> textpromptview?
03:36 < glaksmono> bhldev, TextDialogView
03:36 < bhldev> inherits view and textview the options are the same
03:37 < glaksmono> if i pass in width and height, it looks fine
03:37 < glaksmono> but for some reason it doesn't respond to me "click"
03:37 < glaksmono> on the button..
03:37 < glaksmono> it never registered
03:37 < glaksmono> when i look at from the UI debugger, the components still sticked at the "messed up location"
03:37 < bhldev> there's no textdialogview
03:37 < glaksmono> moreover there's no "action" parameter seems like?
03:38 < glaksmono> bhldev, https://github.com/gameclosure/menus#textdialogview-class
03:38 < bhldev> use textpromptview
03:38 < glaksmono> ahhh
03:44 < glaksmono> bhldev, how do i register event listener on that view?
03:44 < glaksmono> on click
03:47 < bhldev> inherts view use InputSelect
03:47 < bhldev> http://docs.gameclosure.com/example/events-input-click/
03:51 < glaksmono> bhldev, i tried this.. https://gist.github.com/glaksmono/04b8910a41f16a092c86
03:51 < glaksmono> doesn't work
03:51 < glaksmono> thoughts?
03:55 < glaksmono> doesn't seem like there's an easy way to build dialog..
03:55 < glaksmono> it hink i'm just going to build it as a view i'm assuming
03:55 < glaksmono> kk
03:56 < bhldev> wrong use of this

17:34 < glaksmono> anyone is around?
17:34 < glaksmono> i'm wondering on how do people usually integrate GC with rails?
17:34 < glaksmono> i found GC has an amazing performance compared to other engine, but the integration with rails is a bit of a hassle. thoughts?
17:34 < glaksmono> catid, ?
17:34 < glaksmono> u there?
17:34 < glaksmono> ;)
18:05 < Godefroy> glaksmono: rails as ruby on rails server-side I guess?
18:05 < Godefroy> glaksmono: you should develop an API with rails and use it from GC with ajax => http://doc.gameclosure.com/api/utilities.html#module-util.ajax
18:06 < glaksmono> got it, can you use rails assets pipeline tho? Godefroy ?
18:07 < Godefroy> for CSS en JS files?
18:07 < Godefroy> you can't use CSS with GC
18:07 < glaksmono> no
18:07 < glaksmono> for images
18:08 < Godefroy> and you should not use external JS in your app
18:08 < glaksmono> well we have other pages as well
18:08 < glaksmono> that gest to the canvas
18:08 < catid> Godefroy: probably not, we're all focused hard on getting some games out, so the devkit gets slowly improved while we do that
18:08 < Godefroy> is it for static images or for UGC images? (user generated content)
18:09 < catid> but there aren't plans specifically for the devkit
18:09 < Godefroy> catid: yes I was pretty sure that your team is working on new games
18:09 < Godefroy> catid: it's too bad that GC development is slower than before
18:10 < Godefroy> catid: some improvements could really enhance GC
18:10 < catid> yeah i wish i had more time to build more tools for it
18:10 < Godefroy> catid: and GC could become more popular :-)
18:10 < Godefroy> you don't plan to hire people to work on GC?
18:11 < catid> we have hired a number of new people
18:11 < Godefroy> \o/
18:11 < catid> but we're very product-focused right now, as the tooling is about where it needs to be
18:11 < Godefroy> you should also setup a feedback website, with Uservoice for example
18:12 < Godefroy> it can help prioritise needs
18:12 < Godefroy> the feedback website for the web service I manage (EklaBlog) is useful to us: http://feedback.eklablog.com/
18:13 < catid> oh nice, hadn't heard of that before
18:14 < Godefroy> I set it up in one day, with SSO (single sign on) and with ticket support
18:15 < Godefroy> so you could set it up in one hours without SSO and without tickets
18:15 < Godefroy> and it's cheap
18:29 < catid> just suggested it to the founders, we'll see what they thing
18:30 < catid> think*
19:04 < PierrickB> catid: I thought devkit was actually GC main product. So the team is working on games to make money / make some advertisement for devkit ?
20:17 < gameninja> hi
21:39 < glaksmono> Godefroy, catid is there general design pattern on integration between GC and rails?
21:39 < glaksmono> using rails asset pipeline?
21:40 < glaksmono> or generally people just use GC's assets pipeline
21:40 < catid> i've never used rails so..
21:40 < catid> by asset pipeline do you mean the build process?
21:40 < catid> or does that include the artist's work also?
22:14 < Godefroy> glaksmono: I suggest you to use GC's design and to keep it simple on rails' side
23:30 < bhldev> rails and gc?
23:30 < bhldev> catid going hiding

14:24 < daimone> maybe someone can help me
14:25 < daimone> when is created GC.app ?
14:27 < daimone> I mean: I have an isometric view instanciated in a js (not the Application.js), but I get the error "GC.app is undefined"
14:37 < daimone> nevermind...
15:15 -!- Luke is now known as Guest31011
16:42 < daimone> does someone know a good source editor for js with, at least,  autocomplete
16:42 < daimone> ?
16:46 < jishnu7> daimone, sublime text
16:50 < rampr> emacs :)
16:53 < daimone> oh, thank you...I will give it a try!
16:53 < jishnu7> vim :)
16:54 < daimone> no no vim is the hell for me ;)
16:55 < daimone> does sublime text need some plugin to works with GC sdk?
16:58 < daimone> no, I think not
16:58 < PierrickB> daimone: no, there is nothing specifically for GC and Sublime text
16:59 < PierrickB> Install package manager for Sublime text and some neat plugins (JsFormat, color picker, docBlockr, etc). You can give TernJS (a smart autocomplete tool for js) a try, but I had some performances issues with SB3.
17:00 < daimone> thank you all, I really hope GC team will develop some sort of plugin for Eclipse
17:01 < daimone> (or something similar)
17:04 < daimone> btw....are there some nice project being developed with GC?
17:38 -!- Athos is now known as Guest962
17:38 < Guest962> hey, i had a questeion, do you guys have an documentation about transitions?
17:39 < Guest962> by that i mean transitions between one activity to another
17:54 < daimone> can you explain a bit more?
18:01 < Guest962> I have a transition between one activity that has settings and the main game. When I select game, the game's background flys in from the right and it's jerky. I was wondering if I could change that.
18:02 < PierrickB> Guest962: Yep, I'm wondering too. Maybe Godefroy can answer
18:03 < PierrickB> I know that for the moment we have the same transitions, but I guess there is a way to change that (GC being open source, that should not be difficult to do so)
18:03 < PierrickB> daimone: We are actually developping a nice little thing with Godefroy and ronan3 , some kind a mobile MMO Tactical RPG, with some geolocalisation stuff in it. It's gonna kick ass !
18:04 < Guest962> yeah my problem isn't jsut the transition, its that the transition looks bad (like it looks that text isn't beign erased and it's just drawing on top of it)
18:04 < PierrickB> daimone: If you are more used to classical IDE like eclipse, you may want to give PHPStorm a try. It's an awesome "IDE" for PHP and javascript, it's really doing a good job. I'm used to SB shortcuts and functions (the magic bar and the multiple cursors), so I don't have the courage to switch, but that's clearly a nice choice.
18:05 < daimone> thank you a lot PierrickB, I will give it a shot
18:06 < PierrickB> It's because the other screen does not really disappear, but is put on a stack. But with "light" screens the animations are pretty nice for us. Some "heavy" screens creates some lags, the transition is not totally smooth
18:06 < PierrickB> Guest962: Do you have a screenshot or a small video ? Do you mean the previous screen is still visible ?
18:06 < daimone> your game sounds very interesting! we are also going to develop something quite small, this is our first experinece in gaming development
18:07 < Guest962> hmm
18:07 < Guest962> no i don't think its still visible
18:07 < daimone> see you soon, job day is ended ;) bye bye!
18:07 < Guest962> let me say it this way
18:08 < PierrickB> ++
18:08 < Guest962> transition to game screen is fine
18:08 < Guest962> but the transition from game screen to win screen is jerky
18:08 < Guest962> because theres text loaded in
18:08 < Guest962> and it comes in from the right
18:08 < Guest962> and it comes in a few times and overlaps
18:10 < PierrickB> hm
18:11 < PierrickB> I think we have the same behavior with screens having a white background
18:11 < PierrickB> the white background is coming, then the left side is changing back to the previous bg before coming back to white
18:11 < PierrickB> I don't see this problem with screens having a picture as a backgrtound
18:12 < PierrickB> Maybe it's the way our screens are designed, I will need to dig in
18:14 < Guest962> yeah
18:14 < Guest962> unfortuantely im at work and i dont have the game in front of me
19:10 < Godefroy> hmm
19:10 < Godefroy> none of the demos (examples) seem to work
19:10 < Godefroy> for example, click on "Launch Demo" in http://doc.gameclosure.com/example/text-fonts-ttf/
19:26 < Guest962> yup in noticed that for a while

22:16 < JoshDC> hey guys this is my first time using IRC and my first time on this chat server. would this be a correct place to ask a quick gameclosure programming question? i'm working on something right now but i'm getting an error and trying to figure out why.

22:50 < PierrickB> JoshDC: Yes :)
22:55 < JoshDC> okay good to know...thanks :)
22:56 < JoshDC> i've been trying to get this running for the last hour or so
22:56 < JoshDC> var effectsImage = new Image({url: 'resources/images/board/jewels.png'});
22:56 < JoshDC> this.render = function (ctx) {
22:56 < JoshDC>     ctx.drawImage(effectsImage, 560, 0, 106, 98, 0, 0, 106, 98);
22:56 < JoshDC> };
22:56 < JoshDC> sorry for the spaces
22:56 < JoshDC> drawImage is giving a type error
22:56 < JoshDC> i can't figure out why
22:56 < JoshDC> the image is loaded correctly
22:56 < JoshDC> render is sending the ctx correctly
22:58 < JoshDC> but the console is showing a type error
22:58 < JoshDC> is this the correct way to load the image for drawImage?
22:58 < JoshDC> if anyone knows, it would be much appreciated
23:03 < JoshDC> this is running correctly, so i know the ctx is coming through and everything else is correct, but not the drawImage:
23:03 < JoshDC> ctx.strokeStyle = 'blue';
23:04 < JoshDC>             ctx.rect(calcX, calcY, 106, 98);
23:04 < JoshDC>             ctx.stroke();

02:17 < daShader> hello
11:40 < daimone> hi, is there an easy way to implement zomm in/out on a isometric view?
12:35 < bhldev> daimone probably not checkout the isometric project
12:36 < bhldev> rome one
12:36 < bhldev> you want pinch to zoom?
12:36 < bhldev> well according to Apple that is patented technology you must pay them one bazillion dollars to use it tyvm
12:37 < daimone> eh?
12:37 < daimone> what do you mean?
12:38 < daimone> we can't implement a zoom in function without go against patented tec?
12:47 < bhldev> no
12:48 < bhldev> you are looking for cover vs contain
12:48 < bhldev> I think it is nontrivial because the HUD and controls would never zoom while the center would zoom
12:49 < daimone> exactly ;)
12:50 < bhldev> http://docs.gameclosure.com/guide/designing-user-interfaces.html game with zoom would need special considerations and stretch to fit while maintaining aspect ratio on pinch
12:57 < daimone> thank you bhldev, I kow it is quite hard so I hoped for a 'out-of-the-box' solution  to zoom only the iso view and nothing else, I will take a closer look later.
13:47 < daimone> I have another question...
13:48 < daimone> it seems that the 'updater' function defined in a 'editorSettings' for an isometric view, is not called when type ='item'
13:49 < daimone> is it work as intended?
14:53 < bhldev> daimone not sure check gc docs don't use random methods from source
15:04 < daimone> ty again bhldev , gc docs doesn't say anything about it. it only describes updater as 'Optional, a function called after modifying the grid.'
16:07 < gameninja> hi all, how r u?

17:47 -!- glaksmono_ is now known as glaksmono
17:47 < glaksmono> anyone is around?
17:53 < PierrickB> glaksmono: I can try to answer ;p
17:54 < glaksmono> i just made an update from master branch
17:54 < glaksmono> and all of the "projects" are gone
17:54 < glaksmono> thoughts?
17:54 < glaksmono> i wanna try the demo
17:58 < PierrickB> Weird.
17:59 < PierrickB> For the examples you need to  basil install examples
18:01 < glaksmono> any thoughts what's the issue with this?
18:01 < glaksmono> https://gist.github.com/glaksmono/04b8910a41f16a092c86
18:01 < glaksmono> i just did ./install.sh again
18:01 < glaksmono> and did basil update
18:05 < PierrickB> My opinion : make a clean install
18:05 < glaksmono> how do you do that?
18:06 < PierrickB> From my experience basil update fails almost all the time
18:06 < glaksmono> how do you make a clean install?
18:06 < PierrickB> I simply clone the while thing again
18:06 < glaksmono> ah ok
18:06 < glaksmono> and then did the ./install.sh again?
18:06 < PierrickB> yes
18:07 < glaksmono> ok
18:07 < glaksmono> lemme do that
18:18 < glaksmono> PierrickB, isn't there a way to compile the assets on gameclosure?
18:18 < glaksmono> i remembered i did that a while back
18:22 < glaksmono> any thoughts about this? https://gist.github.com/glaksmono/04b8910a41f16a092c86
18:41 < PierrickB> Arf, I have no idea why you get this error
18:41 < PierrickB> It seems path related
18:41 < PierrickB> Are you on windows or mac ?
18:42 < PierrickB> For the assets compiling, it's doing it by itself while compiling the game normally. I don't know how to manually do it
18:43 < glaksmono> i'm on mac PierrickB
18:46 < glaksmono> do you use the obj-c for gameclosure?
18:46 < glaksmono> PierrickB,
18:46 < glaksmono> i'm wondeirng if you've tried using their html5 v
18:47 < PierrickB> Atm we are not using any obj-c for native stuff
18:47 < PierrickB> Godefroy: coded some plugins for android, but we don't have the hardware to do the same for iOS yet
18:50 < glaksmono> PierrickB, so you guys are using gameclosure on native apps right?
18:50 < glaksmono> and btw this is the issue: https://github.com/gameclosure/devkit/issues/94
18:58 < PierrickB> Ha ok, so it was a remote problem.
18:58 < PierrickB> Yes, we are using GC to build an android+ios+browser game
18:59 < PierrickB> To make a plugin you will have to code some native (java and obj-c), and then it will be easily usable with GC.
19:19 < glaksmono> what backend do you use PierrickB ?
19:27 < PierrickB> NodeJs :)
19:30 < PierrickB> This way everything is in Js
19:30 < PierrickB> Make it pretty nice to code, we can switch from one side to the other pretty easily (with small team that's nice to be able to change a developer's focus)
19:38 < Godefroy> yep :)
19:38 < Godefroy> anybody from GC here?
19:38 < Godefroy> could somebody tell catid to come back please :3
19:45 < glaksmono> haha i see
19:45 < glaksmono> may be i should take a look on node js
19:57 < Godefroy> glaksmono: yep! actually GC is based on Nodejs (but with syntax suger, a classes system and a great display engine), so it's worth learning it :-)
20:00 < glaksmono> cool!
21:51 < glaksmono> anyone is stuck becuz of this issue? https://github.com/gameclosure/devkit/issues/94
21:51 < glaksmono> i'm stuck!
21:51 < glaksmono> help!
22:18 < PierrickB> glaksmono: I guess there is nothing you can do except waiting
22:47 < Godefroy> glaksmono: does GC work on your computer or is it a total installation crash?
23:05 < glaksmono> not even working at all
23:05 < glaksmono> i can't use basil
23:05 < glaksmono> :(
23:19 < Godefroy> do you use windows? or linux or mac?
23:26 < Godefroy> what errors do you have?
23:27 < glaksmono> i'm on mac Godefroy
23:27 < glaksmono> i pasted the error on that issue
23:28 < glaksmono> https://github.com/gameclosure/devkit/issues/94
23:28 < glaksmono> my last comment..
23:28 < glaksmono> :(
23:41 < glaksmono> thoughts Godefroy ?
23:59 < PierrickB> Went to sleep
23:59 < PierrickB> He told me that it looks like tealeaf is getting a time out
23:59 < PierrickB> I think that's on GC side
--- Day changed Tue Feb 18 2014
00:17 < glaksmono> PierrickB, are they working on this now? cuz i can't use GC at all... :(
00:18 < PierrickB> Seems that yes, from the link you gave me. One of their dev answered you and told you they were working on it.
01:01 < glaksmono> anyone know if there's any update son this? https://github.com/gameclosure/devkit/issues/94
01:01 < glaksmono> seems like it screws everyone up.. lol
08:22 < bhldev> catid boo
10:04 < Godefroy> catid: hey what's up?
17:02 < rampr> http://www.weeby.co/ -> is this GC's new product ?
17:09 < oodavid> rampr, was just reading all of that
17:09 < oodavid> looks like it is, the labs link goes to GC github page
17:11 < rampr> yeah
17:16 < oodavid> could be interesting
17:17 < oodavid> social integration  is a massive part of a lot of new games
17:17 < oodavid> and the idea of rolling my own is not exactly daunting, but  annoying
17:17 < oodavid> simple because I know it's been done a thousand times already
17:38 < glaksmono> https://github.com/gameclosure/devkit/issues/94 <-- still open issue?
17:38 < glaksmono> hi catid !
17:50 < Greg11> hey guys, i'm building a game using GC. does anyone know why GC doesn't do any marketing? it's a little scary investing time in tech that only a few people are using (vs something like corona).
17:55 < Greg11> my guess is they are waiting for the tech to get to a certain level first? (although it seems pretty sound)
18:13 < PierrickB> That was fast
18:13 < catid> good morning
18:13 < catid> yeah yesterday we had a ton of stuff happening all day and i didn't have a chance to look at the dev.gameclosure.com server
18:14 < catid> the guy who was working on it recently left and it seems to have been shut down somehow
18:14 < catid> trying to get it started up now..
18:14 < PierrickB> Hi catid
18:14 < PierrickB> Good, glaksmono was getting crazy ;)
18:15 < catid> part of it was that i didn't have access to our EC2 until late last night.. :)
18:17 < glaksmono> cool!!!
18:18 < glaksmono> PierrickB, i know right.. installing again now.. let's see if it's back
18:18 < glaksmono> still getting a timeout for tealeaf thing
18:19 < PierrickB> Don't think that it's fixed, catid said "trying to get it starter"
18:19 < PierrickB> started*
18:19 < glaksmono> aw snap
18:19 < glaksmono> i'm like totally blocked.. :(
18:20 < PierrickB> :/
18:38 < glaksmono> btw sooo
18:38 < glaksmono> we also write in javascript for iOS and Android devices?
18:38 < glaksmono> i didn't know that, i thought u added a library
18:38 < glaksmono> that's cool!
18:46 < Godefroy> glaksmono: that's the point :-)
18:47 < Godefroy> catid: hey have you seen the Flappy-bird-like that I developed last week with Game Closure? http://godefroy.me/un-flappy-bird-like-pour-la-saint-valentin-sur-browser-et-android-a106514868
18:47 < catid> no i haven't, cool!
18:47 < Godefroy> catid: I released it under GPL3 license, so you can use it as a demo if you want to :-)
18:48 < catid> waiting for one of the founders to come in to get access to EC2 since i didn't get the invite somehow..
18:48 < glaksmono> aw snappp.. thanks for the updates catid
18:48 < catid> urk it runs too slow for me to play =(
18:48 < catid> at least in the browser
18:49 < catid> lemme try on native Godefroy
18:49 < glaksmono> how do you send push notification from GC? i'm wondering.. hmm
18:49 < Godefroy> catid: btw I think your startup should make an effort towards developpers with simple processes: easy access to bug tracker (on Github for example), feedback box, forum, and a little community management :-)
18:49 < glaksmono> it has issue tracker from the devkit i think?
18:50 < glaksmono> and i love this irc :D
18:50 < catid> glaksmono: we have local notifications but not push notifications in the public devkit
18:50 < glaksmono> what's the difference? catid
18:50 < catid> push notifications can originate from the internet and start your app on someone's phone remotely
18:50 < catid> local notifications are like timers that go off sometime in the future and re-engage users
18:50 < Godefroy> catid: I know how to handle all of that, we do that everyday for EklaBlog (thousands of users, 11 millions unique visitors / month). If GC founders are interested, maybe I can offer a custom prestation :-)
18:51 < Godefroy> to build a good community around GC, you need a good management and good tools :-)
18:51 < catid> passing that along to them now..
18:52 < Godefroy> GC devkit is great, that would be too bad if too few developers use it
18:52 < Godefroy> catid: great :-)
18:53 < catid> what's a good Email address i can give them to contact you?
19:01 < glaksmono> catid, is there ETA on https://github.com/gameclosure/devkit/issues/94 ?
19:03 < catid> hrm let's try to work around it for you
19:03 < catid> you can download the JAR file here: http://androidtweak.in/downloads/tealeaf-build-tools-0.5.2.jar
19:04 < catid> copy that file into devkit/lib
19:04 < catid> and try installing again - you should be set
19:04 < catid> (by running ./install.sh)
19:06 < Godefroy> catid: contact@godefroy.me
19:06 < catid> thanks
19:08 < Godefroy> btw we experienced some issues with grayscale images, they were weirdly cropped by spriter (tealeaf I guess) in spritesheets
19:10 < catid> with the latest spriter?
19:11 < catid> is there any chance that i can get a copy of the images?  i'll pass them to the guy who rewrote it last month
19:11 < catid> i think he would just need the folder containing the images that sprite poorly
19:17 < Godefroy> yep, this two for example: http://ekladata.com/lOyZZ5ejS0GaQWllNN7ZXwHG3GI.png and http://ekladata.com/Cm00XFyPT-SQ3eZ7-DRiLGkQR9I.png
19:31 < catid> so those by themselves
19:31 < catid> i'll pass it along
19:31 < catid> would it be possible to also see the output of the spriter too?
19:31 < catid> so i can see what the issue is
19:32 < catid> they're located under build/debug/native-android/spritesheets
19:32 < catid> for example
19:32 < catid> inside your game folder
19:39 < glaksmono> hey catid, is there ETA on this? https://github.com/gameclosure/devkit/issues/94 (or is there a way to get around it?)
20:01 < PierrickB> He gave you a method glaksmono ...
20:01 < Godefroy> catid: I sent you an example by email
20:01 < PierrickB> link to the tealeaf jar.
20:05 < glaksmono> ah may be i was dropped out of the internet.. PierrickB
20:05 < glaksmono> didn't see the message..
20:05 < glaksmono> what's the method?
20:08 < PierrickB> <catid> hrm let's try to work around it for you
20:08 < PierrickB> <catid> you can download the JAR file here: http://androidtweak.in/downloads/tealeaf-build-tools-0.5.2.jar
20:08 < PierrickB> <catid> copy that file into devkit/lib
20:08 < PierrickB> <catid> and try installing again - you should be set
20:08 < PierrickB> <catid> (by running ./install.sh)
20:09 < glaksmono> ah!
20:09 < glaksmono> thanks a lot PierrickB
20:09 < glaksmono> gonna do that soon
20:11 < glaksmono> catid, PierrickB does this look normal? https://gist.github.com/glaksmono/04b8910a41f16a092c86
20:13 < glaksmono> ah it works tho
20:32 < glaksmono> anyone know how to change the name on the simulator?
20:32 < glaksmono> i changed the manifest.json name but for some reason it still registered on the old name..
20:32 < glaksmono> thoughts ?
20:50 < PierrickB> Yeah the errors are "normal"
20:50 < PierrickB> No idea about the manifest stuff
21:02 < catid> yes glaksmono that looks OK
21:04 < catid> Godefroy: passed the spriting issue on to derek, he's looking at it
21:16 < catid> yes glaksmono that looks OK
21:16 < catid> my task this week is to do some refactoring in the native Android code in the devkit, so that the GL surface is divorced from the JavaScript states
21:17 < catid> in our Weeby.co messenger integration product this is causing a problem where the JS code is being reinitialized when switching in/out of the game, which is either inefficient or causes leaks/crashes
21:18 < catid> i believe in existing devkit games this is not an issue except perhaps on rare phones that destroy the GL context when homescreened
21:18 < catid> should have it done Friday.  we're probably going to move the tealeaf-build-tools.jar file onto S3 for more reliable hosting soon
21:19 < catid> but i also do not have access to the DNS records either so i can't fix it until the founders come in today
21:22 < glaksmono> i'm wondering on how do i figure out which references the "projects" that's specified on the simulator?
21:22 < glaksmono> it seems like it's runnning some code that i didn't expect..
21:22 < glaksmono> catid, ?
21:23 < glaksmono> catid, http://screencast.com/t/Jzz8xcKf <-- wherte is the code location..
21:25 < catid> hm
21:25 < catid> so you'll click on the project you want to simulate
21:25 < catid> it is selected in the upper left
21:25 < catid> hit the simulate button under it
21:25 < glaksmono> yeah..
21:25 < glaksmono> but i'm not sure where's the code that's running is from
21:25 < catid> oh are you using Chrome?
21:25 < glaksmono> yeah
21:26 < glaksmono> basically i'm seeing that it's throwing error that it shouldn't to
21:26 < glaksmono> i.e. it says that it has some import oouya..
21:26 < glaksmono> i never done that in the code that i have
21:26 < catid> interesting
21:26 < catid> the only one that should have ouya is the Platformer
21:27 < catid> which is the running bird icon
21:27 < glaksmono> catid, is there a way to start a project outside of the devkit folder?
21:29 < catid> yes
21:29 < catid> for example if your game is under ~/dev/chris/myGame then just navigate to that folder in the console
21:29 < catid> and type in `basil register`
21:30 < catid> it will then show up in the web simulator list
21:31 < glaksmono> ok i have a way around it
21:31 < glaksmono> soo i deleted other project
21:31 < catid> it uses the icon and shortName in the manifest.json file for your game in the list
21:31 < glaksmono> and then for some reason it still stuck on the simulator
21:31 < glaksmono> how do you remove it?
21:31 < glaksmono> from the simulator?
21:32 < catid> if it is gone from the disk you can type `basil clean-register` to delete missing games
21:32 < glaksmono> hmm doesn't seem to do anything
21:33 < catid> hrm well it is supposed to work :)
21:33 < catid> lemme check if it's broken sec
21:33 < catid> also try typing `basil` and using `basil help` to see what the commands do
21:34 < catid> ok i just tried out `basil clean-register` and it worked: "Cleaned out 1 projects that were invalid from the register."
21:52 < glaksmono> yeah i got it somehow now.. catid
21:52 < glaksmono> and now i'm looking at this issue: http://screencast.com/t/5pEu7P5OUp4
21:52 < glaksmono> any thoughts?
21:58 < catid> https://s3.amazonaws.com/build-tools.gameclosure.com/tealeaf-build-tools-0.5.2.jar
22:00 < glaksmono> ? catid
22:11 < catid> ok we got the tealeaf build tools rehosted properly
22:14 < glaksmono> ah nice
22:14 < glaksmono> cool!
22:14 < catid> if someone can please retest ./install.sh and make sure that is working that would be great
22:15 < glaksmono> i'll do that
22:15 < glaksmono> catid, btw is there issue on this example? http://doc.gameclosure.com/example/sound-effect/
22:15 < glaksmono> for some reason it doesn't play the sound on my iphone
22:16 < glaksmono> catid, i can just redo ./install right?
22:18 < catid> maybe a little bit of an issue
22:18 < catid> on android/ios it is important to preload sounds
22:18 < catid> because otherwise they will play back delayed the first time
22:18 < catid> also, MP3s take a very long time to load on some Android phones
22:18 < catid> so it's a good idea to have MP3 and OGG versions of all your sounds
22:19 < catid> just place the two files side-by-side in the sounds resources, like "bonk.mp3" and "bonk.ogg" and the build system will choose between them
22:19 < glaksmono> interesting ok
22:19 < catid> preloading is explained in the documentation..
22:20 < catid> yea
22:20 < catid> iPhone only supports OGG i think
22:20 < catid> err only supports MP3
22:20 < catid> there's more info here: http://doc.gameclosure.com/guide/audio-assets.html
22:21 < catid> preloading is explained here: http://doc.gameclosure.com/guide/load-assets.html
22:29 < glaksmono> hmm doesn't seem to be working.. even with preloading catid
22:29 < glaksmono> thoughts?
22:29 < glaksmono> btw i'm trying to load it on my iphone's browser..
22:29 < glaksmono> by just using python SimpleHTTPServer
22:29 < glaksmono> on the build release folder..
22:29 < catid> so you're trying it on an iOS device?
22:29 < catid> oh
22:30 < catid> did you convert the OGG files to MP3?
22:30 < glaksmono> yeah..
22:30 < glaksmono> yeah
22:31 < glaksmono> i have both OGG and mp3
22:31 < glaksmono> it works on the simulator though
22:31 < catid> ok lemme give it a shot
22:31 < glaksmono> here's my code: https://gist.github.com/glaksmono/561c82623a65fb83716e
22:35 < glaksmono> and why would it be looking for these files.. http://screencast.com/t/AQZVkA7njS haha
22:37 < glaksmono> ah and i see validationFailedWithMessage:resultCode:]: unplayable URL (http://10.0.1.30:8000/resources/audio/sound1.ogg.mp3) (error=0 -- Movie could not be played.)
22:38 < catid> ok this works when you do `basil debug native-ios --clean` to build it
22:38 < catid> and the mp3 version is already available
22:40 < glaksmono> wait, i'm using the browser version..
22:40 < glaksmono> html5
22:43 < catid> i'm not sure..  but most of what we do is for native builds not HTML5 games in browsers
22:44 < catid> if you want to rapidly test on the device you can try the Test App
22:45 < catid> there is documentation for the Test App in the native docs on the website
23:01 < glaksmono> ugh..
23:01 < glaksmono> sound is really not working at all on browser
23:09 < catid> that may be true
23:10 < glaksmono> snap!
23:10 < glaksmono> actually.. interestingly sfx are working on android phones..
23:10 < glaksmono> but not on iphone..
--- Day changed Wed Feb 19 2014
00:20 < glaksmono> catid, is there a roadmap on sound related issues for html5?
00:21 < catid> i don't believe that's going to get fixed, but let me check with someone
00:25 < catid> yeah that's very low priority for us.  the Kik messenger runs an iOS-based browser so i might look into it but not sure when i can get to it
00:25 < catid> i imagine something in the JavaScript code needs to change when running on Safari to get that to work
00:26 < catid> it would be somewhere in the devkit/lib/timestep/src HTML5 audio code if you have time to look at it
01:04 < glaksmono> hey catid, do gameclosure lazy load the javascript files?
01:05 < glaksmono> on the release build at least..?
01:08 < catid> on `basil build native-android` for example it will package all the JS files into one large JS file
01:08 < catid> and then on the device it will load them all at once
01:09 < catid> the code for each game JS file won't execute until it's referenced by other code though
01:09 < catid> when it's running remotely through the Test App,
01:09 < catid> i believe the same thing happens and it's delivered as one large JS file
01:10 < catid> this is probably also true for browser builds
01:10 < glaksmono> well, it won't execute doesn't mean it's not loaded right?
01:10 < glaksmono> basically i have lib/foo.js
01:10 < catid> for instance if the game JS code changes it rebuilds the package and reloads it on the device
01:10 < glaksmono> that needs to be loaded before window.load
01:10 < catid> (in the Test App)
01:11 < catid> if you import it, then it will be loaded first i believe
01:12 < catid> like "import src.view.TOSView as TOSView;" will load the Terms of Service view code in one of our games before continuing with the current file
01:14 < glaksmono> i guess the question is... since GC is using "imports" (https://github.com/gameclosure/js.io).. whether that is lazy loading the javascript files?
01:14 < glaksmono> what is the difference between using "imports" and including the javascript files
01:14 < catid> in the example above, the TOSView.js code at the top level will execute immediately
01:15 < catid> ie. to set its exports for the user
01:15 < catid> if the same file is imported by two files, then it will only execute the first time
01:15 < catid> so this is a sort of lazy loading
01:16 < glaksmono> so if i wanna make sure that i load a library file
01:16 < glaksmono> before widow.onload
01:17 < glaksmono> i just put that as the first import statement on Application.js?
01:17 < catid> yeah
01:17 < glaksmono> ok let me try that
01:17 < catid> and it will run before window.onload is set to anything
01:27 < glaksmono> catid, is there docs on this somewhere?
01:54 < glaksmono> catid, is there docs on this somewhere?
01:56 < catid> sorry just disconnected, docs on what?
01:56 < glaksmono> on how the "import" works.. catid
01:57 < glaksmono> of what you just explained..
01:57 < glaksmono> so that i can share that with the team
01:57 < glaksmono> :)
01:57 < catid> hrm lemme check
01:58 < catid> yes: http://docs.gameclosure.com/api/utilities.html#import
01:58 < glaksmono> ahhh, but there's no details like how it's being loaded
01:58 < glaksmono> how it's loading the files..

15:25 < oodavid> Is it all good on the cold front?
15:26 < Godefroy> oodavid: hi :-)
15:27 < oodavid> Godefroy, how are you?
15:29 < oodavid> Just been looking at your flappybird codebase
15:31 < Godefroy> oodavid: fine and you?
15:31 < Godefroy> oodavid: cool :-)
15:33 < oodavid> yeah awesome
15:33 < oodavid> I setup a devlog on the tigsource forums for my GC game

15:34 < Godefroy> give us the link
15:39 < oodavid> http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=38408
15:53 < Godefroy> great!
15:58 < oodavid> It might be good for GC to have something like this
15:59 < oodavid> that is, a devlog area
15:59 < oodavid> I've seen a few familiar faces on the GC IRC / google groups, but not sure what everyone is doing
16:13 < Godefroy> yep, I talked catid about that yesterday
16:14 < Godefroy> he transferred my suggestions to GC founders, so I guess we'll go further on that :-)
16:25 < oodavid> Excellent!
16:46 < jishnu7> Godefroy, can you share the source url of your game ?
17:05 < Godefroy> jishnu7: my last mini-game is here: https://github.com/Godefroy/flappy-jolie-geekette
17:06 < Godefroy> jishnu7: but we don't open sourced our main game we are working on
17:07 < jishnu7> Godefroy, I actually started coding a flappy bird clone, last Sunday. Didn't get time to complete.

14:19 < daimone> hi
14:19 < daimone> I'm trying the test app on a nexus 7
14:19 < daimone> and I'm experinecing a lot of strange problem
14:20 < daimone> orientation never change
14:20 < daimone> a good amount of demo application doesn't works
14:20 < daimone> and all app are not show in fullscreen but only in a portion of it
14:20 < daimone> does someone else has those problems?
15:00 < Godefroy> daimone: nope, no problem for me
15:00 < Godefroy> daimone: maybe a bug in the very last version of GC devkit
15:00 < daimone> what is your version of sdk?
15:00 < daimone> I mean GC
15:01 < daimone> mine is 0.1.45
15:12 < daimone> ok it seems that the only way to update the code in the tablet is to reinstall the testapp each time
15:13 < daimone> but orientation doesn't work. I have defined "supportedOrientations": ["portrait","landscape"], in manifest.json but nothing happens when i change screen orientation
16:12 < Godefroy> daimone: I prefer to keep a single orientation for each game so that graphics are easier to set. Actually, I don't know any game that works with 2 different orientations

17:22 < milkyj> hey guys, new to gameclosure - went through the example tutorials and successfully compiled "hello world" to IPA and got the tingles. n00b question : Can I use node modules (commonJS)? If so, any reference examples?
18:13 < milkyj> basil n00b question - is there a way to use nodejs modules in gc client?
18:22 < oodavid> milkyj, hello
18:22 < oodavid> not tried node modules before, but if it's pure javascript then yeah
18:22 < oodavid> although I think you'd lose out in the native benefits that the GC objects come with
18:22 < oodavid> I'm a fellow developer like you, so don't take my word as gospel
18:23 < oodavid> out of curiosity, which module(s) are you interested in using?
18:29 < milkyj> I am interested in oboejs : http://oboejs.com/ right now but it would be great to leverage all npm! I was looking at js.io but don't understand it.
18:31 < oodavid> Have you looked at http://doc.gameclosure.com/example/sockets-basic/
18:31 < oodavid> catid, is there a way to ignore source files during compilation? (akin to .gitignore)
18:33 < milkyj> oodavid, I did but I would like to use http. I created a socket based multi-player game and we had to fall back on old-school polling because different mobile carriers block ports and sockets. It was a nightmare, glad we used socket.io

17:40 < oodavid> evening / morning!
18:48 < PierrickBigNet> yop !
18:48 < PierrickBigNet> Long time no see, catid , is everything ok at gameclosure ?
18:50 < catid> good morning
18:51 < catid> it's going okay
18:51 < catid> yesterday i released updated versions of the amplitude and flurry plugins
18:52 < catid> we've taken on a new company name Weeby.co to market our services in the mobile IM gaming space
18:53 < catid> there are some native fixes upstream in the remote image load/cache system
18:53 < PierrickBigNet> Nice, new stuff !
18:54 < catid> we're almost done working with the QA guys at Kik and Tango messengers
18:54 < catid> should have our first app up soon
18:54 < catid> for each of those
18:55 < PierrickBigNet> I need to check this weeby thing. Some king of gaming social network connected to IM apps ?
18:55 < PierrickBigNet> I know I already said that, but GC would definitely benefit if all this stuff was posted on the dev blog ! :D
18:59 < catid> the idea seems to be to build games directly for IM services
19:00 < PierrickBigNet> Ho
19:00 < catid> hopefully one of those titles will get big
19:00 < PierrickBigNet> I did not even know that this existed.
19:00 < catid> it's a new market for games
19:00 < PierrickBigNet> The idea make sense, but aren't games limited by the app ?
19:01 < catid> sometimes - for example Kik requires that the games run in the mobile browser
19:01 < PierrickBigNet> I mean, is kik just giving a link to the google play store ?
19:01 < PierrickBigNet> Ha, alright
19:01 < catid> however, Tango integration is more like Facebook integration
19:01 < PierrickBigNet> So it's completely separated from the stores
19:01 < catid> and the app runs separately
19:01 < catid> yea
19:02 < PierrickBigNet> I'm surprised. Tango can do this kind of thing on IOS ?
19:02 < catid> in the Tango case we're on the actual app/play store
19:03 < catid> but they essentially promote our game and link to it from the Tango IM app
19:03 < catid> and our app is branded for Tango
19:04 < PierrickBigNet> Ok.
19:14 < Godefroy> interesting
22:22 < peoro> Hello
22:24 < peoro> I have a working HTML5 game (it doesn't use the DOM, just HTML5 Canvas and Audio). I'd like to have it working on Game Closure in order to build it for mobiles.
22:26 < peoro> I could not find many details on how to port an existing game to Game Closure: most of the documentation focuses on the UI and on Game Closure libraries...
22:26 < peoro> Would you know where to find something on how to port an existing HTML5 Canvas game to Game Closure?
23:39 < catid_> most of the GC devkit API works the same way as HTML5 canvas
23:39 -!- catid_ is now known as catid
23:40 < catid> however, some features are missing
23:40 < catid> also the imports are different
--- Day changed Wed Apr 02 2014
00:26 < peoro> yeah, I fixed the issues with the import: concatenated all of my javascript files in a single one, added the `exports` object and fixed a few things (like the fact that the global `this` object is different from `window`)
00:27 < peoro> it looks like there are still too many road blocks though: the canvas context should be passed around everytime I render (and this is an issue for my application logic), and I guess I'd have to rewrite most of the event support (mouse/touch input, timers etc)
00:28 < peoro> GC looks like a pretty neat framework, but it differs too much from standard HTML5 to be used for existing projects... or this is at least the impression I got
00:28 < catid> ideally you shouldn't have to pass around a context object unless you are doing offscreen rendering
00:29 < catid> our game sprite objects are ImageViews i believe
00:29 < catid> and the context-stuff is handled internally
00:33 < peoro> uh, ok then, I was misleaded then... Since GC.Application.render is taking a context as parameter, I thought I could use it only during the current frame (thought it was somehow related to some internal GL stuff).
00:33 < peoro> I'll keep digging then: that was my biggest issue :)
00:35 < catid> offscreen canvas is used for special operations like linear adds between subsets of objects in a scene
00:35 < catid> or drawing games
00:35 < catid> you should take a look at the Platformer game for example
01:42 < peoro> wow, just wow! you were right, catid: my application is up and running!
01:42 < peoro> thanks for your help :)
01:43 < peoro> I'll just need to fix the input, the rest (including timers) seem just fine! :D
01:43 < catid> oh nice
02:00 < jishnu7> catid, are you guys still going to update gameclosure ?
02:01 < catid> yeah i'm going to do another release of the devkit for any fixes we come up with
02:01 < jishnu7> catid, here is one from me. https://github.com/gameclosure/timestep/pull/27
02:02 < catid> oh thanks!
02:02 < catid> there is another pull request i need to look at also
02:02 < catid> will put this on my TODO list as well
02:04 < jishnu7> catid, Is there any way to implement rounded corners for a view without using an image ?
02:04 < catid> we use a 9sliced image for our rounded dialogs and buttons
02:04 < catid> i think there are examples of that in the menu library
02:05 < jishnu7> without an image ?
02:05 < catid> no, we use an image for those
02:05 < catid> curves aren't supported by the render code
02:05 < catid> so it would be tricky to emulate with short line segments
02:05 < jishnu7> I tried with the canvas context which is getting at this.render()
02:06 < jishnu7> but view is already rendered and whatever I'm rendering is coming on top of that.
02:07 < jishnu7> if I do clear, transparency will be lost.
02:08 < jishnu7> but I hacked together a way. first I drew a rectangle with same size as view, then a path with quadraticCurveTo and lineTo'
02:08 < jishnu7> this is working on browser
02:08 < jishnu7> but not on device
02:11 < jishnu7> catid, my question is, is it possible to clear the view keeping views in the intact.
02:12 < jishnu7> is it possible to clear a view keeping views in the background intact
