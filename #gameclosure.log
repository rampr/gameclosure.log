08:01 < rampr> in android 2.3 versions we are seeing crash reports that "unable load library tealeaf"
08:01 < rampr> Any idea why ?
08:02 < rampr> Stack trace -> http://pastebin.com/mxGDdGu6
08:04 < rampr> sorry this is in android 2.2
19:24 < catid> rampr: that could happen if your build failed for some reason
19:25 < rampr> the build succeeded and works in other phones
19:25 < rampr> do you think some step in the build failed ?
19:28 < rampr> I see this warning Android NDK: WARNING: APP_PLATFORM android-15 is larger than android:minSdkVersion 8 in ./AndroidManifest.xml
19:29 < rampr> nothing else actually
19:31 < catid> what kind of phone is it?
19:32 < catid> perhaps we don't support that model
19:32 < rampr> catid: we are seeing the crash reports only on 2.2 and 2.3 android versions
19:33 < rampr> 1 sec, I'll tell you the devices
19:33 < catid> SDK version 8 would be 2.2
19:33 < rampr> yeah
19:34 < catid> so the projects build under devkit/addons/native-android/build/projectName/
19:35 < rampr> Galaxy Tab (GT-P1010), Optimus Chat (hazel), Milano (C5120)
19:35 < catid> you can run "ant debug" in a terminal at that path to create an apk
19:38 < rampr> I'll try that, we have a motorola droid running 2.2, I'll test with that
19:44 < rampr> same error
19:44 < catid> that should give you full control over all the android manifest settings etc
19:45 < catid> i'm worried maybe the new jpeg static library includes only armv7 code
19:46 < rampr> I'm using the 38 version of devkit
19:46 < rampr> was the jpeg library added later ?
19:47 < catid> yeah it was added in 39
19:47 < rampr> so that should not be it
19:48 < catid> we also added a bunch of other static libraries in 38 i think
19:48 < catid> libcurl etc
19:49 < catid> let me verify those are all armeabi armv5te machine code
19:52 < rampr> okay,
19:52 < rampr> I compiled whack the mole and I've put the build log here -> http://122.178.251.179:2222/build.log
19:52 < catid> thanks
19:56 < rampr> I just noticed somebody has reported the same crash with an older version of our app, that was using basil version 30
20:00 < catid> oh interesting
20:00 < catid> maybe the problem is this:
20:00 < catid> "settings for AndroidManifest: value for icons is not a string"
20:04 < rampr> that's the only error there
20:05 < catid> it could be that something important is getting skipped because of that error
20:07 < rampr> I opened the androidmanifest in the build/projectName, don't find any icons there
20:46 < rampr> I tried removing the icons object in manifest.json and the error doesn't appear in the build
20:47 < rampr> app still crashes, so it is something else I guess
20:52 < catid> hrm still looking at it
21:22 < catid> ok as far as i can tell we do still support armv5te in android builds
21:22 < catid> it's working on a galaxy y
21:23 < catid> and we appear to have armeabi and armeabi-v7a binaries
21:23 < catid> so i'm a little stumped!
21:23 < catid> have you tried running the latest devkit?
21:25 < rampr> no, haven't tried it, I'll try the latest devkit
21:25 < rampr> what version does galaxy y run ?
21:25 < rampr> I was reading this article - http://mpigulski.blogspot.in/2010/09/debugging-dlopen-unsatisfiedlinkerror.html, but got nowhere
21:25 < catid> 2.3.5 i think
21:26 < rampr> do you guys have a 2.2 ?
21:26 < rampr> we have a cyanogenmod 2.3 and it doesn't crash there
21:26 < catid> 2.2 only problem hm
21:26 < catid> i don't have one on hand
21:27 < rampr> the emulator ?
21:27 < catid> i'll try to find one
21:27 < rampr> thanks, I'll try latest devkit in the meantime
21:34 < catid> another idea
21:35 < catid> try removing some of the static libraries from tealeaf/jni/Android.mk LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES
21:41 < rampr> curl-prebuilt libzip cpufeatures libjpeg libpng libjansson libv8a andprof
21:41 < rampr> I'll remove curl, zip, jpeg ?
21:44 < catid> i have to download and install some things to use an AVD with the right specs so will take a while
21:44 < rampr> doesn't compile without curl, I'll add it back
21:44 < catid> try removing just one of those, like jpeg
21:44 < catid> ah yeah maybe that won't work then
21:44 < catid> right because it will complain about references..
21:45 < rampr> :)
21:46 < rampr> somebody had a similar issue here - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/android-ndk/xavfYBp2DaY
21:50 < catid> ah try compiling for android-8
21:50 < catid> i'll do that soon
21:50 < catid> need to install API level 8
21:51 < rampr> where do I set it to version 8 ?
21:51 < catid> in that build/projectName path
21:51 < catid> there's a project.properties file
21:51 < catid> edit that to target android-8
21:52 < rampr> okay
21:52 < catid> then run android update project -p .
21:52 < catid> from the build/projectName dir
21:52 < catid> doesn't work for me cuz it's still downloading
21:55 < rampr> then ant debug right ?
21:57 < catid> yea
21:57 < catid> there's a new android ndk out too: 9b that may have fixed something related to this
21:58 < rampr> [aapt] /Users/rampr/work/hashcube/devkit/addons/native-android/TeaLeaf/res/layout/edit_text_handler.xml:17: error: No resource identifier found for attribute 'textCursorDrawable' in package 'android'
21:58 < rampr>      [aapt] /Users/rampr/work/hashcube/devkit/addons/native-android/TeaLeaf/res/layout/edit_text_layer.xml:12: error: No resource identifier found for attribute 'textCursorDrawable' in package 'android'

21:59 < rampr> that's an error, not sure if it is version 8
21:59 < rampr> if it is because of version 8
22:00 < rampr> I have ndk 9b, 38 version doesn't work without that
22:01 < rampr> confirmed setting it to version 8 throws the above errors
22:01 < rampr> not able to build the binary too
22:04 < rampr> damn, it now compiles and I get an apk
22:07 < rampr> okay found out how to reproduce, I modified AndroidManifest.xml and changed targetSdk also to 8
22:09 < catid> ok
22:09 < catid> interesting
22:09 < catid> let me show this to the guy who wrote the edit text stuff
22:44 < catid> for now you can patch it by removing the textCursorDrawable property
22:44 < catid> the problem it solves is that the text color is wrong (white on white) so we disable the system theme that way
22:45 < catid> apparently it's supported on 2.3+ oops
22:50 < catid> though we're not sure if that's the issue you're seeing
22:50 < rampr> oh cool, I'll try it
22:52 < rampr> another one
22:53 < rampr> devkit/addons/native-android/build/whackthatmole/bin/AndroidManifest.xml:34: error: Error: String types not allowed (at 'configChanges' with value 'keyboardHidden|orientation|screenSize').
22:54 < catid> hrm
22:54 < catid> i guess keep removing keys
22:54 < catid> it seems less likely that this is the problem
22:55 < catid> most likely thing is that a dynamic library like libz has a different API on version 2.3+
22:55 < catid> pthread is another one we use
22:55 < rampr> compiled, apparently screenSizes doesn't work in api 8
22:55 < rampr> going to test on device
22:56 < rampr> oh okay,
22:58 < rampr> yes, still crashes
22:59 < catid> ls
23:00 < catid> shot in the dark maybe it's pthread stuff
23:00 < rampr> :hmm
23:04 < rampr> saw another crash with this stack trace earlier today
23:04 < rampr> E/AndroidRuntime(  281): FATAL EXCEPTION: GLThread 25
23:04 < rampr> E/AndroidRuntime(  281): java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No configs match configSpec

23:05 < rampr> don't remember the device I was trying, do you think it could related to this ?
23:36 < catid> oh there's nothing you can do there
23:36 < catid> that means that the device does not support OpenGL
23:36 < catid> we just give up in that case
23:37 < rampr>  oh okay, so unrelated
23:58 < catid> ok finally have a 2.2 emulator running
--- Day changed Tue Nov 19 2013
00:02 < catid> yup i see the problem in the emulator
00:03 < catid> hrm i think i need to enable OpenGL
00:05 < catid> maybe, if it gets that far
00:08 < catid> oh interesting
00:08 < catid> Android String class does not support isEmpty on this platform
00:08 < catid> may be causing a problem
00:11 < catid> updated the localnotify plugin to fix that
00:11 < catid> going to look for other usage
00:40 < catid> ok localnotify plugin is now compatible with API level 8
00:40 < catid> but that wasn't your issue
01:14 < catid> so
01:14 < catid> i was able to get an strace like in that blog post
01:14 < catid> by doing this: am start -n XXX && ps && ps && ps && ps && strace -v -p
01:14 < catid> in the simulator
01:14 < catid> and guessing what PID would be used next
01:14 < catid> for the app
01:15 < catid> but it doesn't print out anything useful
01:17 < catid> it shows the app reading the length of the .so file, then mmapping it
01:17 < catid> then closing, unmapping and printing errors
01:18 < catid> this is not entirely unexpected
01:18 < catid> the "missing library" is NOT one that we provide
01:18 < catid> it should already be present on the device
01:18 < catid> so the strace logs shouldn't show it trying to load something
01:19 < catid> or the library that has the missing function
01:30 < catid> ah here we go
01:31 < catid> ld.bfd libssl.so libcrypto.so libtealeaf.so -rpath=/copied22libs/ has no missing symbols!!
01:31 < catid> wtf
01:32 < Mazyod2> \o/
01:46 < catid> maybe we need to change the linker to use bfd
01:46 < catid> in our builds
02:43 < catid> getting close to giving up on this one
03:36 < rampr>  dozed off, it's morning here too
03:50 < catid> fixed it
03:50 < catid> the solution is complicated
03:50 < catid> i have had to hex-edit some .so files and change the load order
03:51 < catid> a few more things to fix in other places now
03:51 < catid> to get 2.2 support working again
04:39 < rampr> yay!
04:47 < rampr> why do the the .so files have to hex edited ?
15:52 -!- Netsplit *.net <-> *.split quits: catid, ronan1, chapel
16:00 -!- Netsplit over, joins: ronan1
19:18 < catid_> good morning
19:21 < catid> still fixing some issues for 2.2 support
19:21 < catid> some of them are my fault actually ^_^
--- Day changed Wed Nov 20 2013
01:10 < catid> verified on a real 2.2 device that everything is working again
01:10 < catid> i'm getting the changes approved by other developers now so ya'll should get it within a week
02:08 < bhldev> still haven't solved the adb takes a million years to upload problem
02:08 < bhldev> quite annoying
02:09 < bhldev> thank god for the simulator
02:09 < catid> wow that is odd
02:09 < catid> i've been uploading with adb all morning
02:10 < catid> seems reasonably fast
02:10 < catid> to various phones
02:10 < catid> though i actually cannot get the AVD to run our games
02:10 < catid> apparently it doesn't support ogles2.0
02:10 < catid> only 1.1
02:11 < catid> and we use shaders..
02:11 < catid> real android 2.2 (api level 8) phones do run our games though
02:11 < catid> AVD was useful to debug the problem rampr was reported
02:11 < catid> reporting*
03:41 < bhldev> it's obviously something wrong on my end I'm just complaining
03:43 < bhldev> btw is there some roadmap for gc somewhere or some plan for the next year or two

02:34 < bhldev> any way to download the gc docs for offline viewing
02:34 < bhldev> the site is hostile to wget and httrack
02:37 < catid> yeah if you just disconnect your computer from the internet and browse to the site it should display as normal
02:37 < catid> we have some special caching stuff turned on
02:38 < catid> so all the text content is saved to your disk
02:38 < catid> i think the pictures are stripped
02:45 < bhldev> also the menu in the dark blue is hostile to touchpunch and other mobile events so it can't be read on ipad
02:46 < bhldev> oh well can't be perfect
02:46 < catid> touchpunch?
02:47 < catid> ooh

16:11 < bhldev> how do you find the syntax errors in your application in the simulator
16:12 < bhldev> doesn't tell you what line in your code the error is
16:21 < bhldev> guess I have to use jslint
16:23 < bhldev> nvm it's right in the basil console
16:23 < bhldev> lol
16:29 < bhldev> btw for the basic list example at http://doc.gameclosure.com/example/ui-list-basic/ the init function for the FilmCell class has a textview, the textview should define size:11 in the options otherwise the text scales and the list is unreadable
23:26 < bhldev> the examples are the best practices for doing this?
23:26 < bhldev> for example the examples usually define one button class subclassing ButtonView then have a list of options, this is the way to do it?
23:27 < bhldev> for like 10 different buttons
--- Day changed Sun Nov 24 2013
01:26 < bhldev> for example http://doc.gameclosure.com/example/ui-grid-movecell/ the text "A button to change the number of rows" appears twice should be something else the second time
14:48 < bhldev> the "flex" option doesn't seem documented in the docs but is used in the examples for show or hide
14:50 < bhldev> nvm found it under layout
15:24 < bhldev> is it possible to do slice scaling with toasts?
15:28 < bhldev> nvm I found that too, inherits from ImageView so I can use all of ImageView ;p
15:56 < bhldev> btw icon.png is missing from the examples repo, needed for the first example for imageview

03:31 < rampr> any ideas why ?
03:44 < catid> that would happen if we were still trying to render from the background
03:44 < catid> should be very rare
03:45 < catid> i can imagine some long-blocking event on the render thread could cause that crash
03:55 < rampr> this could be related to an ANR ?
04:00 < bhldev> yes, three week vacation

06:04 < glassesmouse> Hello guys
06:04 < glassesmouse> I've got a question about the menus plugin that comes with devkit
06:05 < glassesmouse> I'm trying to resize the menus when user change the device orientation
06:05 < glassesmouse> I tried to use updateOpts() to update the TextDialogView width and height
06:05 < glassesmouse> but it doesn't work
06:06 < glassesmouse> the view still keeps it's original width and height
06:06 < glassesmouse> is there a way to resize the menu?
06:24 < bhldev> hi
06:24 < bhldev> glassesmouse: hi
06:24 < bhldev> I'm just a user don't work for gc, but I'm going through examples right now
06:26 < bhldev> try toasts, they extend ImageView and I had success using 9-slice scaling with them
06:27 < bhldev> I'm pretty sure that TextPromptView is bugged, was trying various options today and it didn't work but at the same time I'm pretty sure I would never use it because native dialog in a game would be way too ugly
06:32 < bhldev> http://doc.gameclosure.com/example/ui-toast/
07:17 < glassesmouse> bhldev Thank you for your suggestion! I'll try it out
08:08 < bhldev> I think the flex docs at http://docs.gameclosure.com/guide/designing-user-interfaces.html#flex should be updated to reflect that flex can also be non-zero non-one values
08:09 < bhldev> for example if it's 3 then the view takes 3/4 of the parent view width and height, seems to be an undocumented but useful feature
08:10 < bhldev> if there's two subviews one flex 3 one flex 1 then the one with 3 takes 3/4, only found it out buried in the examples

05:30 < bhldev> continuous is spelt wrong on the http://docs.gameclosure.com/ page under examples - animation
05:39 < bhldev> strangely the code in the example itself is not... so developers are better spellers than web designers ;p
07:36 < bhldev> the example at http://doc.gameclosure.com/example/animation-multibox/ here http://doc.gameclosure.com/example/animation-multibox/ should use your bind() function and animate.easeIn instead of animate.EASE_IN
07:36 < bhldev> it looks like a Java dev wrote that example lol

19:57 < jishnu7> catid, any chance of merging this ? https://github.com/gameclosure/native-android/pull/10
19:57 < catid> i was just about to make a release to fix the edittext on iOS
19:57 < catid> let me take a look
19:59 < jishnu7> I'm not sure whether this requires some other changes or not.
20:00 < catid> i will at least check to make sure that it doesn't break normal android builds that don't use it
20:00 < catid> have you tried it with your games?
20:03 < catid> merged it in, will test in a bit

01:12 < catid> ugh found a crash in Android native
04:32 < bhldev> what unit testing framework do you guys use
04:50 < bhldev> where is the documentation for this kind of code this._textView.onInputSelect = bind(this, "onClick"); should it instead be this._textView.on('InputSelect', bind(this, "onClick")); ?
04:51 < bhldev> from http://doc.gameclosure.com/example/sound-background/ looks like it's using a different way of binding events

12:24 < catid> yeah i've been working on some high priority stuff
12:24 < catid> we need to fix a big memory leak related to canvas
12:25 < catid> the new games are using a lot of extra canvases so they need to be garbage collected in the texture manager
12:25 < catid> which means i need to go back and edit and regression test all the fonts etc
12:25 < debarko> which version is it affecting?
12:25 < catid> once this is done i'll do another release
12:25 < catid> just internal stuff

00:22 < jaayden> Hi I have a question about the current state of TextEditView and TextPromptView
00:23 < jaayden> Does anyone here have any knowledge of the fix that is in the works for those Views?
00:39 < jishnu7> jaayden, what is the problem ?
00:40 < catid> good morning all
00:41 < jishnu7> good morning catid
00:41 < jaayden> for the latest release, when using texteditview or TextPromptView, this causes a crash in iOS on a device or in a simulator
00:42 < jaayden> I think it was some changes made in the native-ios repository in the last month but not sure
00:42 < catid> yes that's a known issue
00:42 < jaayden> I was wondering if I could find out what the fix is or if there is some advice of how to rollback
00:42 < catid> you can fix it yourself while you wait for us to get another release out by removing the count: selectors
00:43 < jaayden> ah ok, which file is that in?
00:43 < catid> from the places where it gets called
00:43 < catid> it's in a few objective C files, let me check
00:44 < catid> tealeaf/platform/TeaLeafViewController.mm
00:44 < catid> dispatchEvent now only has one selector
00:44 < catid> remove the 'count:' one
00:45 < jaayden> here [[js_core lastJS] dispatchEvent:&evt count:1];
00:45 < jaayden> just remove that parameter?
00:45 < catid> yeah remove count:1
00:46 < jaayden> is this the only location or are there multiple spots?
00:46 < catid> 3 locations in that file
00:47 < jaayden> ok, ill try that, one other thing, I only actually was able to get the TextPromptView to work as expected
00:47 < jaayden> is it possible now to use the TextEditView without a prompt appearing?
00:48 < jaayden> to type text directly in the textbox?
00:48 < jaayden> on an iOS device
00:48 < catid> hm
00:49 < catid> it may still have some bugs in the last release
00:49 < jaayden> I can use the promptview but was curious
00:49 < catid> we are using it for that; there is some trickiness with getting the text input to GO AWAY when the keyboard is closed
00:49 < catid> that is not entirely cleaned up yet but is working
00:50 < catid> the text input also cannot move once you fix it to the screen
00:50 < catid> so no reflowing
00:51 < catid> i've seen issues with custom keyboards on android
00:51 < catid> it's getting better because we need it to work :)
01:01 < jaayden> Ya, I was getting the issue where the keyboard was not appearing after tapping on the texteditview, but Ill try again today and see what happens
12:33 < bhldev> what kind of storage or db do games use with gameclosure
12:34 < bhldev> can I use something like yathit.com or indexeddb
12:45 < rampr> we use localStorage
12:46 < rampr> it is a key value store, everything being strings
12:47 < bhldev> theoretically there should be nothing preventing me from including an external js file with no dependencies that uses localstorage or indexeddb as a backend because the gc canvas is webkit right
12:48 < bhldev> guess only one way to find out
15:22 < rampr> bhldev: gameclosure itself exposes a localStorage api
15:22 < rampr> when testing on the browser, it uses html5 localStorage
15:22 < rampr> but on the device it is probably mapped to something else

01:49 < stet> Hi GC folks. Can someone point me to a simple paint example/demo for GC? i.e. just free draw with your finger...
01:50 < stet> Coding it for HTML5 canvas is easy enough, but I'd like to see how it fits into the GC framework.
02:03 < Rastikko> Hi
02:03 < Rastikko> How is game closure to do a professional project? It's in an ok phase or still need some more development
02:03 < catid> good afternoon
02:04 < catid> stet: to do drawing-type effects, we draw quads that look like line segments between each x,y point
02:04 < catid> it's a little awkward compared to the canvas version but runs fast in practice
02:05 < catid> there's an old demo project of mine that does the drawing: https://github.com/gameclosure/mitri
02:05 < catid> and x,y touch input is pretty simple to work out from the docs
02:06 < catid> over at http://docs.gameclosure.com
02:06 < catid> Rastikko: it's pretty mature at this point.  we've been using it for some popular mobile games on Android/iOS for over a year now
02:07 < catid> the majority of bug fixes are in new features for new releases
02:17 < stet> Ok, here's another total neophyte question: I built the "platformer" sample for iOS and in the XCode project it shows appropriate icons but when running in the emulator or on a device, the icon doesn't come through--it's an empty rectangle. Any idea why?
02:19 < stet> I'll check out your demo project--thanks for the link.
02:21 < stet> Just tried building Whack-that-mole for iOS and get the same generic blank icon despite an icon showing up in the XCode project.
02:23 < stet> All I'm doing is "basil debug native-ios" and then running the XCode project that opens.
02:24 < stet> Same thing for demoShooter.
02:26 < stet> They all work, but the icons don't get included. Sorry if I'm missing something obvious, but it kind of looks like a bug?
05:11 < bhldev> hrm wonder why people ask questions then leave
05:11 < bhldev> *real* programmers leave their computers on 24/7
05:12 < catid> it was in a web browser
05:12 < catid> just found a way to speed up iOS load time quite a bit
05:12 < catid> for our latest game we do a ton of localStorage updates
05:13 < catid> it turns out our localStorage implementation on iOS is synchronizing manually on each write
05:13 < catid> which takes about 500 ms
05:13 < catid> and we were doing like ~30 of these on startup
05:13 < catid> huge speed improvement for one of our games, and the others are snappy now
05:14 < catid> if you want to improve things just comment out the synchronize line
05:25 < catid> pretty nice improvement so i made a new 0.1.44 release for it

21:09 < stet> Hello again, GC folks. I'm back with more beginner questions...
21:09 < stet> Yesterday I was asking about icons not showing up when building for iOS. Still don't know why that is, but I tried building for native android and the icons seem fine there.
21:10 < stet> My Android-related question is regarding orientations. It appears the only options are portrait and landscape in the manifest.json file. The platformer example has landscape, but when I run it on a device it only allows one of the landscape orientations.
21:12 < stet> Looking in the AndroidManifest.xml that it generated, it appears that's because it specifies "landscape" rather than "sensorLandscape."
21:13 < stet> Any way to get "sensorLandscape" in the AndroidManifest.xml that GC outputs?
21:16 < stet> Also, sorry if this isn't the best place to be asking this stuff. Please point me to a forum or whatever, if one exists.

03:21 < bhldev> what's the market for casual 2d games like, still money makers?
03:22 < bhldev> saw a game on ipad where you drag a ninja around like a rag doll and do things to it and train and level it up and it was 3d... seen a half dozen 3d games in a row now
03:22 < bhldev> people playing them on the train bus etc., not just random
03:23 < Mazyod1> clumsy ninja is awesome
03:23 < bhldev> yeah that's what I saw
03:24 < bhldev> anybody ever try to do something to gc 3d, maybe three.js etc.?
03:24 < Mazyod1> Unity3D eats the 3D market
03:25 < bhldev> how good is their 2d stuff they just branched into that
03:25 < Mazyod1> it's nifty for those who like their visual and augmented goodness
03:26 < Mazyod1> it has most of what you would want in a 2d game
03:26 < Mazyod1> minus a tile map, mind you, i think that's not there
03:26 < bhldev> I can't stand that abstraction though if I wanted that I would use construct 2
03:27 < Mazyod1> I have no idea how people use construct
03:27 < Mazyod1> it looks so... simple
03:28 < Mazyod1> Unit has a skeleton animation system, splines, paths, particle systems, ...
03:28 < Mazyod1> it's the real deal when it comes to abstarction
03:28 < bhldev> guess I would go ejecta and three.js if I ever wanted 3d
03:29 < bhldev> or fastcanvas and phonegap
03:30 < bhldev> I hope I never have to stoop to that level but if 3d is the whole market I can't ignore it
03:30 < Mazyod1> I believe that the 2d market is still much bigger on mobile
03:31 < Mazyod1> I can count tens of top apps that are 2d, but not so much that are 3d
03:32 < bhldev> maybe that means it's easier to get in with a decent 3d app
03:32 < Mazyod1> that's an optimistic way to look at it
03:33 < bhldev> another issue is I'm not an artist
03:33 < Mazyod1> 3d is a nightmare then
03:33 < bhldev> more than 2d?
03:33 < Mazyod1> absolutely
03:33 < Mazyod1> all the steps involved in a sinlge asset
03:34 < Mazyod1> modeling, z-brush, painting, rgging, animationg
03:39 < bhldev> I will hire an artist anyway
03:39 < bhldev> guess I'm stuck with 2d for the forseeable future
03:44 < Mazyod> and I am back to my original nickname
03:44 < Mazyod> somehow

16:53 < Neco> hello
16:54 < Neco> anyone knows how to propagate an InputStart event after handling it?

17:39 < usandfriends> Hello GameClosure, Although your install script for MaxOSX is very user-friendly (I'm running it right now), all the logging from the script causes Terminal to slow down a lot. After the script finished, Terminal lags by ~10s and requires a restart. You should break up your script into may scripts that make the user restart Terminal or you should suppress all the logging information that comes from git and npm. Just a suggest
17:41 < usandfriends> Seems like you guys are sleeping! I'll put a comment in the support page.
17:42 < usandfriends> There is nothing in the support page yet, so I will just stay online so you can respond. :)

19:32 < bhldev> back up
19:33 < bhldev> got rid of windows as host at last from now on windows belongs in virtualbox only
19:38 < bhldev> safe to pull from git now?
22:01 < bhldev> anywhere I can look at box2d integration samples?
22:45 < bhldev> heh had a moment of weakness almost bought impact.js
--- Day changed Thu Dec 26 2013
06:16 < bhldev> anyone have experience running emscripten to get a working box2d then integrating with GC? not sure if it's worth trying
23:54 < bhldev> is your company called "gameclosure"? lol
23:54 < bhldev> I hope you have enough VC to last a few years

09:49 < scull> Hi everyone
10:05 < scull> I'm just discovering GameClosure and it looks great ! Nowadays, i try to develop a game with KineticJS and performances on Android Platform are very poor ! But, i've a question : i read documentation and tutorials, but i can't find if it's possible to make clic area based on svg path (like in KineticJS) ? The goal is to show a world map and catch the continent clicked by the player
10:10 < scull> So, i want to display only one picture (the world map) and make click area for each continents, based on path (many points wich make a polygon)
10:18 < scull> Does anyone have an idea to do this ?

22:46 < joshthecoder> I'm working on an add-on that requires some Android support jars. Is the best way to include them to copy/symlink them into my <addon>/android folder than add them to the config.json?
22:46 < catid> good afternoon
22:46 < catid> that's what we've been doing
22:47 < catid> i'm actually working on a mixpanel plugin right now for android/ios which is leading me to improve the plugin system to support more file types
22:48 < joshthecoder> only issue is if you have duplicate jars and dex will complain.
22:48 < catid> it's true
22:49 < catid> i don't think we have a way to check for duplicate jars by file name right now.  let me double-check
22:49 < catid> actually we do
22:50 < catid> if you add it to the config.json "jars" group
22:50 < catid> it will lump the jar in with all the other addons
22:50 < catid> and just use one instance of it for the build, or at least that is the intent
22:51 < joshthecoder> ah okay
22:51 < catid> was that not in the docs?
22:51 < joshthecoder> let me double check I may have looked it over
22:52 < catid> ok looks like i did a writeup here for the jars key: http://docs.gameclosure.com/native/android-plugin.html
22:52 < catid> but i didn't say anything about it trying to de-dupe the jars
22:53 < catid> lemme know if you think it should be in the docs or if the de-dupe is broken for some reason
22:53 < joshthecoder> okay thanks

04:56 < bhldev> so any news?
15:30 < bhldev_> nothing new for the new year?
18:38 < catid> bhldev_:  i think our plan is to prioritize stability
18:38 < catid> all of our efforts right now are going into developing products
18:39 < catid> and bug fixes will get tossed back into the public domain periodically
18:39 < jishnu> catid, any chance of supporting windows phone any time soon ?
18:40 < catid> the most recent figures place it at 2.5% of the global market
18:40 < joshthecoder> BB10 :)
18:40 < catid> so, we unfortunately do not have the engineering resources to target it
18:40 < catid> BB10?
18:40 < joshthecoder> BlackBerry
18:40 < catid> oh
18:41 < catid> i'm just repeating what the guys in charge are telling me about it
18:41 < catid> because we occasionally re-evaluate that
18:41 < joshthecoder> well games do work in html5 browsers so there's always that option I guess.
18:43 < jishnu> catid, so there is a chance of supporting wp in coming years ?
18:43 < catid> too early to tell
18:48 < bhldev_> catid stability is good just don't go bankrupt lol ever think about making a user friendly front end for all this stuff?
18:50 < bhldev_> maybe some code generation tools, drag pictures around, edit properties... might bring in more people
18:51 < bhldev_> I'm not sure if the html5 browser build still works
18:52 < bhldev_> one of the reasons to choose GC over other frameworks is html5 browser build
18:57 < bhldev_> anyway make lots of games and don't go bankrupt, that's what most people I know are afraid of with GC that you will disappear and people will have invested time in your framework for naught lol
18:59 < catid> i don't think we're in danger of disappearing anytime soon
18:59 < catid> we don't really have a money problem
18:59 < catid> no worries :)
19:06 < joshthecoder> do you guys host or know of any good meetups in the bay area?
19:15 < catid> meetup.com is a very rich resource here
19:15 < catid> we do have a thursday game night we host, and other startups typically hang out here
19:16 < catid> it might resume next week, will try to remember to tell you next week
19:26 < joshthecoder> cool
21:52 < bhldev_> catid_ good because I don't have a lot of cash I'm a starving microsoft line of business developer lol
21:53 < bhldev_> I think the primary reluctance of people is they don't want to expand beyond canvas and primitive operations because they think investing time in third-party tools could be overwhelming
21:53 < catid> by people you mean HTML5 engine developers?
21:53 < bhldev_> well too bad canvas doesn't have a scene graph, they will either have to reinvent the wheel or use something
21:53 < bhldev_> yeah I think so
21:54 < catid> yeah that was our impression too
21:54 < catid> we want to provide good tools for casual games that don't require incredible tooling
21:54 < catid> like 3D games
21:54 < bhldev_> well 3d is almost beyond casual
21:54 < bhldev_> you guys don't support three.js right
21:54 < catid> right
21:55 < catid> the real time savers are fast development time and code reuse
21:55 < bhldev_> anyway I think some vids or tutorials could help a lot maybe I will do something next year
21:55 < catid> on the software side
21:55 < bhldev_> yeah hobbyists don't care about speed they would rather spend two years and reinvent the wheel
21:55 < catid> our toolkit could be improved with better animation support to make the artists happier
21:55 < bhldev_> sorry guys I make a fuckton of money two years is a fortune lol
21:56 < bhldev_> I don't think artists will ever like it unless you make a construct2-like frontend
21:56 < bhldev_> or impact has a level editor too
21:56 < catid> well i still think that a flash animation importer would be really powerful
21:57 < bhldev_> eww flash
21:57 < bhldev_> lol
21:57 < bhldev_> yeah most devs are still flash cause you can do things with it
21:57 < catid> flash is how a lot of people like to work actually.. i've been told it's the dominant tool
21:57 < bhldev_> yeah me too
21:57 < bhldev_> if it was the only tool
21:57 < bhldev_> I would be gone
21:58 < bhldev_> when did you guys move from your own license to MPL?
21:58 < bhldev_> that was late in 2013 right
21:58 < catid> pretty soon after release
21:58 < catid> early 2013 i think
21:58 < catid> we had far too many complaints
21:58 < bhldev_> about license? lol
21:58 < catid> yeah, it required a splash screen
21:59 < bhldev_> yeah that would be bad that puts you in... what's that l company
21:59 < bhldev_> the one with the canvas accel
21:59 < bhldev_> ludei
21:59 < catid> right
21:59 < bhldev_> well
22:00 < catid> on the software side another powerful tool we explored was a time machine that allowed you to scrub execution of a live game back and forth
22:00 < catid> in the browser
22:00 < bhldev_> my suggestion is be less tight lipped about your projects if at all possible if people see you using the toolkit for games they know they would be more willing to use it also if you put out roadmaps or projects months in advance or ideally a year they would be less fearful of your company going kaput
22:00 < bhldev_> I think your last twitter or blog post is from october
22:00 < catid> it actually worked for simple games, but for our products it would get out of sync and the developer for it was not motivated enough to deliver it
22:01 < bhldev_> maybe you asked a lot of him lol
22:01 < catid> it was a lot yeah
22:01 < catid> very cool stuff
22:02 < bhldev_> anyway I think gc is underappreciated there's really not too many alternatives for a javascript engine
22:02 < catid> well we're rebranding the company soon and releasing more info, but i don't think i can give any details yet
22:02 < catid> so roadmaps etc are forthcoming
22:02 < bhldev_> it lacks physics engine, even though most games don't need rigid body physics most people see no box2d and run away... even though most box2d ports are horribly outdated
22:03 < catid> yeah C++ physics would be nice also, with JS callbacks on registered impact events etc
22:04 < catid> also explored the idea and decided not to do it
22:04 < bhldev_> casual games live or die by physics imo
22:04 < bhldev_> yeah it's a little too much
22:04 < catid> none of our games have realistic physics or physics puzzles
22:04 < bhldev_> should be easy way for other people to integrate javascript physics though
22:05 < catid> JS ports of box2d are very slow last i checked
22:05 < bhldev_> I think so too the only hope is emscripten ports
22:05 < bhldev_> I will try it next month when I'm not lazy see what happens
22:05 < catid> not saying physics puzzles aren't great, just that we haven't tackled it yet.  if our games team decided it was a good idea we'd port box2d to make it happen
22:06 < bhldev_> well sounds great
22:06 < catid> it's not a bigger challenge than any of the other things we solve each week imho
22:06 < bhldev_> yeah I don't think it is either
22:06 < bhldev_> you guys do great things
22:06 < bhldev_> now don't go bankrupt
22:06 < bhldev_> lol
22:06 < catid> =)
22:14 < bhldev_> oh and you need a real vbulletin type forum thing
22:15 < bhldev_> ok later
22:15 < catid> the google groups is OK i think
22:15 < catid> a lot of open source projects use that
22:15 < catid> later on
22:19 < bhldev_> well you could keep it but if you wanted people to talk about games, art or off-topic they wouldn't do it in google group you need a bbs for community
22:19 < bhldev_> anyway that's just my thoughts
22:19 < catid> true
22:20 < catid> one of our founders runs a popular BBS in his spare time; it's certainly doable
22:20 < bhldev_> or bitcoins
22:20 < bhldev_> I bought $5k usd in peercoins on monday it's up 40% I feel like a genius
22:20 < bhldev_> lol
22:20 < catid> bitcoins?
22:20 < catid> very nice
22:21 < catid> i owned a bunch of PPC and LTC for a while
22:21 < bhldev_> it will crash again though I will hold for a year or two... don't do it, 99% are ripoffs
22:21 < catid> they have definitely been up and down
22:21 < bhldev_> you cleared out?
22:21 < catid> yeah
22:21 < catid> in the last rally
22:21 < catid> since china got out of the game, the price has been too weird to buy in for me
22:22 < bhldev_> well china won't be able to stop it, government never can stop black market
22:22 < catid> so i'm in twitter stock right now
22:23 < catid> hope you're right.  BTC is fantastic for us geeks
22:23 < bhldev_> well I'm playing long game so I don't care about weird prices as long as fundamental is there... I think it is for LTC and PPC, almost nothing else
22:23 < bhldev_> I feel sorry for dogecoin
22:24 < catid> dogecoin was SUPPOSED to be a joke afaik
22:24 < bhldev_> if only the dev had taken it semiseriously and made it properly the marketing would have boomed it
22:24 < bhldev_> yeah
22:24 < catid> i don't trust LTC because most of the miners are botnet operators
22:25 < catid> because it's designed for CPU mining
22:25 < bhldev_> but if I was the dev as soon as i saw real people putting real money in it I would have either warned them or sent out a shit ton of patches to make it serious
22:25 < catid> heh
22:25 < bhldev_> yeah all my $ is in PPC
22:25 < catid> when BTC surged, LTC barely moved iirc
22:25 < catid> it's not trustworthy even as an investment tool
22:26 < bhldev_> I think that PPC will overtake LTC and get to 100
22:26 < bhldev_> when the 51% attack comes and it will come
22:26 < catid> PPC has some good engineering improvements; a friend explained it to me a few months ago
22:26 < bhldev_> on bitcoin rather... the 51% attack will be devastating
22:26 < catid> ripple is interesting too
22:27 < bhldev_> once bad news happens it's impossible to control it will be like bad restaurant reviews
22:27 < bhldev_> well no way I'm buying ripple
22:27 < bhldev_> I don't even completely get it lol
22:27 < bhldev_> and I can't anyway
22:27 < catid> yeah i haven't done my due diligence with ripple either so cannot talk about it
22:27 < bhldev_> I"m in Canada and I don't want my money overseas so I can only buy from Vault of Satoshi or other North American exchanges
22:28 < catid> icic
22:28 < bhldev_> I know ppc won't make me rich but if it gives me enough $ to finally kill the student loan I'll be happy
22:28 < bhldev_> if not oh well it was fun and a tiny drop
22:29 < bhldev_> I was going to make vids to show people how to do it but I don't want grandma buying 10k of it and losing it all or high school kid dropping out to do it so
22:29 < catid> heh
22:30 < catid> what i've learned about gambling is to be happy with 10% returns and GET OUT
22:30 < catid> because it's often possible to be *up* at some point.  but if you keep playing, the house wins
22:30 < bhldev_> anyone who knows how to do it wouldn't need vids anyone who doesn't know shouldn't get into it
22:31 < catid> on 10% returns you can get the same benefit of working a contracting job or two for much less work
22:31 < bhldev_> http://brianlimdev.blogspot.ca/ I posted about bitcoin seriously thinking of removing it and def not uploading the vids on how to buy it yet
22:31 < bhldev_> maybe I'll upload the vids but put a big disclaimer
22:32 < bhldev_> yeah it seems not worth it
22:33 < catid> i like the black theme blog
22:33 < bhldev_> maybe it's worth it for people who can't make money any other way but if you can't make money any other way then shouldn't be wasting money on stupid shit
22:34 < bhldev_> def all the time I spent on this already is a big money loser I could have done the usual contract work and gotten more
22:34 < bhldev_> thx
22:34 < bhldev_> I'm not going to spend any more time on it, put the coins on a DVD and locking it up for a year or two
22:34 < bhldev_> any more time and it's a gip
22:35 < bhldev_> better spent on gameclosure
22:35 < bhldev_> lol
22:40 < catid> GC is a great project.. i mean even if i didn't need money it would be a great project
22:40 < catid> i've been coding for like 19 years now
22:40 < catid> it's about the artistry too
22:42 < bhldev_> well I like that it's a foundation for my data driven game ideas so I don't have to solve bullshit platform problems
22:42 < catid> sorry to get philosophical about it :)
22:43 < bhldev_> I also like the documentation
22:44 < bhldev_> gc is low level enough to make me feel smart but high level enough so it's not a pain in the nuts
22:44 < bhldev_> I couldn't stand using a "level editor"
22:44 < catid> well you're chatting proficiently on *IRC*
22:44 < catid> so you're definitely not a drag and drop person
22:44 < bhldev_> maybe
22:45 < bhldev_> aren't there irc clients for bozos?
22:45 < bhldev_> idk never looked lol
22:45 < bhldev_> I assumed there are like ICQ
22:45 < catid> ogod ICQ
22:45 < catid> just dated yourself :P
22:46 < bhldev_> oops
22:46 < catid> i still remember my ICQ #
22:46 < catid> it's burned forever into my brain
22:46 < bhldev_> I don't and I wish i did because there were so many girls on it
22:46 < bhldev_> they're probably all married now lol
22:47 < bhldev_> actually I'm timeless one time I talked to some old fogey on the bus about C64 and TRS-80 and he was shocked I knew about it
22:47 < catid> i started coding on a C64, never used a TRS-80
22:47 < bhldev_> I bet I'm 15 years younger than you
22:47 < catid> 29.5
22:47 < bhldev_> ah well don't worry I'll pay for your pension
22:47 < bhldev_> lol
22:48 < bhldev_> ok bye and don't go bankrupt fire people if you have to lol
22:48 < catid> are you 15? :)
22:49 < bhldev_> no
22:49 < bhldev_> you have been coding since 10 years old?
22:49 < catid> yeah
22:49 < catid> used to write BASIC in daycare, sort of stumbled on it by accident trying to play games
22:49 < bhldev_> funny
22:49 < bhldev_> my favourite game was... crush crumble and chomp
22:50 < bhldev_> I used to steal newspapers to look for weird phone numbers to call and find underground bbses
22:50 < bhldev_> ok bye lol
22:50 < catid> later on

20:28 < athos> hey, can anybody tell me how i can prevent my application from entering sleep mode within this framework>?
20:43 < bhldev> there's a setting
20:43 < bhldev> maybe manifest.json
20:55 < Guest71418> ivlookedi n teh documentaqtion and i couldnt find anything, i know in native ios you can use, "[UIApplication sharedApplication].idleTimerDisabled = YES;" is there anyway i can put that into manifest.json?
20:59 < bhldev> dunno ask catid
21:48 < oodavid> Is there a way to do complex masks / cropping using multiple Views? Say 3 "spotlights" that move independently
22:03 < oodavid> All that I can see on the docs is a "clip" property of UI-View objects
--- Day changed Sun Jan 05 2014
02:21 < bhldev> oodavid: you can set z or sort order for view
02:22 < bhldev> I don't think masking that would require polygon hitbox and all there are is circles and squares
02:33 < oodavid> I'm not sure I follow - is there a preferred site for code so I can send an example?
02:37 < bhldev> I don't work for gc I'm just a normal guy
02:37 < bhldev> sec
02:40 < oodavid> no worries
03:00 < bhldev> oodavid: http://docs.gameclosure.com/guide/designing-user-interfaces.html#layout-order
03:01 < bhldev> then you would use images with transparency to achieve the desired effect

19:27 < catid> one of our games used accelerometer for input so no touch input
19:27 < catid> meaning the game could appear idle to android
19:27 < catid> or ios
19:27 < catid> to fix that i implemented a stayAwake feature on the device object:
19:27 < catid> device.stayAwake(true);
19:27 < catid> be sure to import device;
19:28 < catid> that will work until your app is backgrounded, and then the normal system power saving stuff will run
19:28 < catid> i'm pretty sure when your app comes back into focus it will resume staying awake
19:28 < catid> you may want to test that
19:28 < catid> if not you can run it again
19:56 < catid> there is now a "mixpanel" plugin for https://mixpanel.com integration
19:56 < catid> will be in the next release of the documentation

00:42 < csantovsky> hey guys, are there any closure workers here?
00:44 < catid> hello
00:44 < catid> csantovsky: i may be able to help
00:44 < csantovsky> I found a couple of thing that could be improved in the basil installation script
00:44 < csantovsky> just wanted to report that
00:44 < catid> great!  could you submit a pull request to github?
00:45 < csantovsky> regarding one of them, yes
00:45 < csantovsky> the second problem is the link to the registration form
00:45 < csantovsky> it requires permission
00:46 < catid> ah interesting.  i haven't done anything with that registration info for a long time
00:46 < catid> please open a github issue for anything you see that's wrong
00:47 < csantovsky> will do that
00:47 < catid> thanks! :)
00:47 < csantovsky> no problem
14:46 < Godefroy> Hey ! catid , is there  a simple way to get screen physical size with GC ?
18:10 < catid> i think so Godefroy
18:11 < catid> lemme check
18:11 < catid> import device;
18:11 < catid> device.screen.width and device.screen.height
18:11 < catid> i believe those are in pixels
18:29 < Godefroy> catid: thx, but I wondered how to get the physical size in cm or in inches
18:29 < catid> oooh
18:29 < catid> that's not exposed to JS
18:29 < catid> it would be different on each platform
18:31 < catid> there is a device.screen.devicePixelRatio
18:31 < catid> i think that just allows you to detect retina screen mode on iOS
22:43 < catid> there is now a new Accelerometer plugin up!
22:43 < catid> it now supports a shake gesture that works pretty well on android/ios
22:43 < catid> if projects of yours are using the accelerometer plugin they will get broken by the new API
23:11 < bhldev__> minus 50
23:14 < catid> am i getting points taken off for that? :)
--- Day changed Wed Jan 08 2014
00:42 < catid> i can't think of a way not to break users of the old accelerometer API - they were receiving events constantly, which most apps using the accelerometer do not need, so it should be off by default
00:43 < catid> so that we can ship the accelerometer support in all our games but only use it when it's needed the API had to change
00:43 < catid> it's also conveniently wrapped in JS now
01:06 < bhldev__> no it's minus 50 outside
01:06 < bhldev__> lol
01:06 < catid> heh

14:43 -!- Netsplit over, joins: oodavid
22:36 < oodavid> I get a lot of [warn] messages when using basil; various messages and warnings - running  on Ubuntu 13.10, the simulator works OK but am attempting to install android-native in order to test
22:37 < oodavid> Few questions: is it an isse? am I better of using a Mac?
22:39 < catid> i get lots of [warn] messages too
22:39 < catid> it should be OK
22:40 < catid> you may want to pay attention to them, because i tried to put helpful hints in those messages
22:40 < catid> you would be better off using a Mac because that's what we use
22:41 < catid> but i wouldn't ask you to buy a whole new computer just for that reason heh
22:42 < Euan> He'd ask you to buy a whole new computer for entertainment, not practicality ;)
22:43 < catid> ^
22:43 < Euan> Might be in your next of the wood later this year, catid
22:43 < catid> oh yeah?
22:44 < Euan> Got my graduate application in to Google Mountain View
22:44 < catid> nice!
22:44 < Euan> Friend who works at their Chicago office gave me an internal referal, which should help. For now I'm just crossing my fingers and hoping :)
22:45 < catid> i hope it works out
22:45 < oodavid> Congrats Euan!
22:45 < Euan> If I get it we can do that meet up for lunch :P
22:45 < oodavid> Are most of the GC lot in California?
22:46 < catid> our offices are on Castro street, a couple mines from the Google Mountain View campus
22:46 < catid> miles*
22:49 < Euan> Should probably head to bed so I can be awake tomorrow. Taking my old landlord to court for unlawful charges, probably sensible to be awake to say my piece.
22:50 < catid> best of luck with everything! :)
22:50 < oodavid> Yeah good luck!
22:50 < Euan> Cheers! ^_^
22:51 < oodavid> catid: maybe for the [warn] messages you should use 1;33 (yellow) to make them look less ominous?
22:52 < catid> should be easy to do, i'll add it to my TODO list
22:54 < oodavid> what a guy
22:58 < oodavid> Am trying to build for android and getting a few errors - http://pastebin.com/djEWT07N - lines: 25, 53, 58 - are they familiar?
22:58 < oodavid> I can build native android apps OK, just not via basil
22:59 < catid> lemme see..
23:00 < catid> it looks like the problem is this: [warn]  Error: could not open `/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.06/jre/lib/amd64/jvm.cfg'
23:00 < catid> those other warnings are nothing important - it just means the google closure compiler for JS is choking on the syntax
23:01 < catid> it will still run fine but that file won't be minified
23:01 < catid> i guess maybe you have jvm installed as root?
23:02 < catid> and you're doing a build from a normal user account?  something like that..
23:02 < oodavid> I'll try building as root :-)
23:03 < oodavid> TBH it was a while back when I installed java et al
23:06 < catid> there may be documentation on our website in the install section that has instructions for what JVM to install
23:07 < oodavid> There is for general GameClosure installation; git, node, java
23:08 < oodavid> and for android the usual, android sdk, ndk but no mention of java version
23:10 < catid> ah sorry it's terse there.  i haven't done much with linux
23:12 < oodavid> Not a problem, you shouldn't have to muck about with general Linux nonsense :-)
23:13 < oodavid> I think you're right about it being installed as root though
23:13 < oodavid> I'll rectify that and see how I get on
23:14 < oodavid> Out of curiosity, does GC offer a code-review service?
23:15 < catid> we haven't so far
23:16 < catid> if you contact Carter@gameclosure.com you may get a response if it's a business question
23:16 < oodavid> Cool, really enjoying working with the devkit, my only complaint is the size of the community for bouncing ideas / finding code; am painfully aware that I'm mostly in cotact with the devs themselves
23:17 < oodavid> ^I might do that in the future :-)

01:10 < csantovsky> hey guys! so I noticed gameclosure emulates the 2d canvas by internally using opengl es
01:11 < catid> csantovsky: yes
01:11 < csantovsky> since I was originally expecting it to emulate the 3d canvas (aka webgl), like (I believe) cocoonjs does, now I wonder if there's a way to send custom shaders to gameclosure
01:14 < catid> it would involve editing the native code for your target
01:14 < catid> here's an overview of the native code: http://docs.gameclosure.com/native/native-stack.html
01:16 < csantovsky> catid: you mean the platform specific code or would it be feasible by changing the native core module? I know both android and iOS use opengl ES, but I am not familiar to their specifics
01:18 < catid> i think most of the required changes would be in C
01:18 < catid> but any new exposed JS functions would require at least a few changes on each architecture
01:23 < csantovsky> I see. I'll check the native core module and try to see what kinds of changes would be necessary for this
01:23 < csantovsky> thanks
04:47 < debarko> catid, u there?
04:47 < debarko> need to understand the reason for having the receiver for install_referrer
04:47 < debarko> i want to deactivate it cause some other plugin i have made needs to get the install referrer.
04:47 < debarko> catid,

14:57 < Godefroy> hi!
14:57 < Godefroy> losure
14:58 < Godefroy> oups, irc client error
17:52 < Godefroy> Euan: hum ok but do you know the name of the parameter to put in it?
17:53 < Euan> Godefroy: If it's that same issue, same as you would in the project
17:54 < Godefroy> I don't find any info about that in the doc :-(
17:55 < Euan> It was a weird thing at the time
17:59 < Euan> But was something about the manifest.json in the GC directory being used over the one in the project
17:59 < Euan> Probably fixed by now.
18:02 < Godefroy> ok, anyway, it can wait
18:03 < Godefroy> I currently have an issue with images, I get this error (on Android):
18:03 < Godefroy> {tex} Unloaded 1 stale textures. Now: Texture count = 18. Bytes used = 118579200 -> 51470336 / 100000000
18:03 < Godefroy> and some images don't appear on some devices (on a Nexus 7)
18:04 < Euan> Tried deleting the bin directory and rebuilding?
18:04 < catid> good morning
18:04 < Euan> Morning catid
18:04 < Godefroy> morning catid :)
18:04 < catid> Godefroy: that doesn't look like an error message.  stale textures get unloaded whenenver the memory limit is reached
18:05 < Godefroy> oh ok
18:05 < catid> ok to do a release build, you should provide the signing key
18:05 < Godefroy> I have a lot of messages like this on our isometric map (we developed our own isometric engine) and it's really slow
18:05 < catid> since release builds are intended for store release
18:06 < Godefroy> on desktop it's ok, but on android it does'nt work as excepted
18:06 < Godefroy> catid: is there a documentation page about signing key?
18:06 < catid> so for android release builds, edit your config.json under your devkit folder
18:06 < catid> there should be lemme check
18:07 < catid> yes it's under the "setup" section: http://docs.gameclosure.com/native/android-setup.html
18:07 < catid> this shows you how to create a keystore and install it in the config file
18:09 < catid> Godefroy: what type of images are not displaying?  is it an alternative format like GIF?  we currently support JPEG and PNG
18:12 < Godefroy> thank you! I was searching in the page "Building for Android"
18:12 < Godefroy> no, only png
18:12 < Godefroy> and only on one device
18:12 < Godefroy> (even if I build again with --clean)
18:24 < Godefroy> oh, I have this error too: {core} WARNING: OpenGL error 1281
18:42 < catid> hm
18:43 < catid> seems tricky to debug without more info
18:43 < Godefroy> yep I understand :-(
18:43 < catid> you could turn on TEXMAN_VERBOSE in texture_manager.c
18:43 < Godefroy> ok
18:44 < catid> reproduce the problem, then send me the log transcript
18:54 < Godefroy> I don't see more errors in the debug console with TEXMAN_VERBOSE enabled
18:54 < Godefroy> I precise I built the app with this command: basil debug native-android --clean --open
19:03 < Euan> Try basil build native-android --debug --clean --open (if that still works)
19:05 < Godefroy> it's equivalent, isn't it?
19:06 < Euan> Should be. But never assume quirks won't happen.
19:09 < Godefroy> ok I just tested, it's exactly the same
19:10 < Euan> Ah well
19:10  * Euan got something to work over summer by using the build version
19:18 < catid> Godefroy: image loading seems to be pretty solid for PNGs in general
19:18 < catid> remote image loading can be a little flaky for the usual reasons
19:18 < Godefroy> yes of course :)
19:18 < catid> especially if the image that is missing has been sprited with other images that are showing up it's probably more related to the JS view containing the image
19:19 < catid> for instance if the view is hidden
19:19 < Godefroy> weird
19:19 < catid> or if the aspect ratio of the phone is causing a layout issue
19:19 < Godefroy> it's working quite well in the browser, on a Nexus 4 and on a Samsung Note
19:19 < Godefroy> *Note 2
19:20 < catid> you could try changing the size of the image to be smaller
19:20 < catid> how large is it?
19:20 < Godefroy> the same problem appears with other images that are really smaller
19:20 < Godefroy> but this happen always with the same images
19:21 < PierrickB> Hi
19:21 < catid> if you're on a mac try running "file build/debug/native-android/spritesheets/*.png" from your game folder
19:21 < catid> PierrickB: hello
19:22 < catid> it will show you the sizes of all the spritesheets - i'd like to see
19:22 < catid> you may want to check if the images that are missing are all sprited together
19:23 < Godefroy> I'm on Linux but whatever :)
19:23 < Godefroy> http://pastebin.com/2txwXysw
19:25 < catid> some real phones may have trouble with graphics larger than 1024x1024
19:25 < catid> it looks like a lot of your graphics are larger than that
19:25 < Godefroy> yep
19:25 < Godefroy> lemme test with a smaller image
19:25 < catid> what will happen is the image will not display on screen
19:26 < catid> i'm not sure if a GL error will happen
19:28 < Godefroy> indeed, it works with smaller images!
19:28 < Godefroy> thanks a lot!
19:28 < Godefroy> we'll be careful about that
19:29 < Godefroy> that's too bad, because we have beautiful big background illustrations, and we'll have to cut them
19:29 < catid> you can squish them smaller..
19:47 < PierrickB> catid:is this linked to GC or to Android/ios ?
19:53 < catid> PierrickB: limitation of mobile GPUs
20:39 < oodavid> Reading the performance guide; I have a fundamental question regarding object {} re-use / reference
20:41 < oodavid> If I want to swap object references (a lot of them) could I used a common "swap" object and not worry about memory leaks?
20:43 < oodavid> or do references not come with any additional overhead (ie I could make new references every time instead of using a "swap")?
20:47 < catid> references are like pointers
20:47 < catid> by analogy, changing a pointer doesn't allocate memory
20:48 < oodavid> shplendid
20:48 < oodavid> catid: what's you're role in the company? I see you everywhere!
20:48 < catid> i'm a random software dude
20:49 < oodavid> haha, thought as much; a dark horse!
20:50 < catid> that's generous!
20:52 < Euan> They see him here, they see him there, they see the catid everywhere
20:53 < catid> hopefully will see you guys all over the top app charts
22:04 < tomh-> hey guys, did the license change to mozilla just recently?
22:10 < Euan> Months ago
22:11 < Euan> The old one still lurks in some places
22:11 < tomh-> ah ok, so how does gameclosure make money now?
22:12 < catid> gameclosure is a startup
22:12 < tomh-> yeah, but whats their business model?
22:13 < catid> for business questions please correspond with carter@gameclosure.com
22:13 < tomh-> oh it was just out of curiousity
22:15 < oodavid> gameclosure isn't actually a gaming platform, it's a game. We're just playing an ultra real game development simulator... right?
22:16 < catid> we've been found-out
22:16 < tomh-> haha
22:17 < catid> that would be funny if we could gamify making games
22:17 < Euan> There definitely isn't a game of that
22:18 < catid> you can spend the 100 points you get for making a new UI screen on buying a fancier splash screen
22:21 < tomh-> btw, are game closure games only meant to be deployed in the appstores or is it still sane to offer the html5 version online as well?
22:22 < catid> we don't spend much time on the HTML5 build, so it may not work as well
22:23 < tomh-> ok

13:29 < Godefroy> hi
13:29 < Godefroy> how can I handle HD and Full-HD versions of our app with GC?
13:48 < oodavid> Godefroy - that really depends on what you want to achieve
13:49 < oodavid> My approach is to analyse the device dimensions and pick the right resource for the job
13:49 < Godefroy> our game has a lot of illustrations, and we want to have the best possible quality on every device
13:50 < Godefroy> so I guess we can build 2 version : HD (1280x720) and Full-HD (1920x1080)
13:50 < oodavid> Well, unless you render your sprites for every conceivable resolution there will always be a compromise
13:50 < oodavid> Oh I see, so only HD and Full HD? Are you not bothered about other resolutions?
13:54 < Godefroy> it would be too complicated to manage more resolutions, nope?
13:54 < Godefroy> are you thinking about lower resolutions? higher? intermediate?
13:55 < oodavid> You say more complicated, but I think if you approach it right then you could be OK
13:55 < oodavid> Have you read this yet: http://docs.gameclosure.com/guide/scaling.html
13:56 < oodavid> It's a good starting point, but I think you need to elaborate based on your requirements
13:57 < oodavid> My approach (I'm not a GC dev) is to break it down into two parts:
13:58 < oodavid> 1 - First calculate which resource "set" you want to use based on device.width and device.height, I just have small, medium and large for now
13:58 < oodavid> so if I was using an old iPhone I'd want to use say resources/images/bg_small.png
13:58 < oodavid> 2 - For every Screen calculate your layout, percentages work well here
13:59 < oodavid> Of course, screens can be different proportions, so I've approached it with extremes in mind
14:00 < PierrickB> Doesnt that mean that you have all resources, in each size, on the phone ?
14:00 < oodavid> 4:3, 16:9, reeeeeaaaally wide, reeeeeaaallly tall, and square
14:00 < oodavid> ^yeah, but they don't have to get loaded
14:00 < Godefroy> ok thanks
14:01 < oodavid> it's a trade-off I guess, but my justification is that: I don't pay for the bandwidth (google / apple do) and those with antique phones are probably used to having no space left
14:16 < Godefroy> yes indeed
14:16 < Godefroy> but I'm worried about the app size
14:17 < Godefroy> because we'll have a loooot of images :)
14:17 < Godefroy> I think we'll begin with an HD version (1280x720) only and we'll give the possibility to load Full-HD graphics from our servers
14:18 < Godefroy> a lot of games are doing that, for example Jungle Heat
14:19 < Godefroy> afaik GC is not yet capable to load and store images from the internet and use them exactly like images in resources folder, right?
14:20 < Euan> It can use base64 encoded uris for images
14:20 < Euan> But you'll have to get and store them manually
14:20 < Euan> And that *can* be a bit of a bugger to do sometimes
14:52 < oodavid> What sort of game is everyone making?
14:59 < Godefroy> I'm working on a tactical MMO with geolocation with PierrickB, ronan1 and 3 illustrators:-)
15:21 < oodavid> Oh nice!
15:22 < oodavid> What role has the geolocation?
15:25 < oodavid> Akin to Ingress?
15:35 < Godefroy> short version: in a zombie apocalypse context, the player will have to conquer places with his survivors through tactical fights
15:36 < Godefroy> it's a solo and MMO game
15:36 < Godefroy> the places to conquer will be real places thanks to Google Maps
15:36 < Godefroy> *Google Place API
15:36 < Godefroy> we don't use Google Maps
15:37 < Godefroy> we're using OSM with the lib I developed: http://www.gameclosure.com/blog/2013/06/announcing-devkit-native-plugin-system-geolocation-plugin-and-map-library
15:37 < Godefroy> and the geoloc plugin
15:38 < oodavid> Sounds pretty cool!
15:38 < oodavid> Assuming you're in Europe by the time?
15:39 < PierrickB> Yep
15:40 < oodavid> UK?
15:40 < PierrickB> Nope, France :)
15:41 < oodavid> Bonjor, mon francais est terrible
15:42 < PierrickB> Haha, almost : 'bonjour'
15:43 < PierrickB> And you  oodavid, US ?
15:43 < oodavid> Like I say, pretty bad
15:43 < oodavid> Nah, UK
15:43 < PierrickB> Ha, a neighbor
15:43 < oodavid> Which works out quite well for me as mine is a side-project; the US wakes up in my evenings!
15:44 < PierrickB> Yep, that's a good timing ^
15:44 < PierrickB> But we are usually working pretty late
15:45 < PierrickB> So that's ok for us, we manage to get in touch with GC staff, usually around 6pm
15:45 < oodavid> They're a helpful bunch like, shame that the community is (as of today) quite small
15:47 < PierrickB> Yes, hopefully they are reactive. The community needs to grow , that's true
15:47 < PierrickB> Especialy for an open source progress
15:58 < Godefroy> yep, but GC is still not enough mature
15:58 < Godefroy> and a version number < 1 is scary
15:59 < oodavid> I've been finding it a pleasure to work with
16:00 < oodavid> Mind you, my app development skills are limit, mostly js based - Titanium Appcelerator, PhoneGap, A little native
16:00 < Godefroy> we are basing our whole business on this framework, so I hope it will last :-)
16:00 < oodavid> As for version numbers, in my main job (not games) I've promised to never get  v1.0 as I know I'll never be finished
16:01 < Godefroy> ahah
16:01 < Godefroy> yep, that's a point of view
16:01 < Godefroy> anyway, I find GC really awesome
16:02 < Godefroy> and I love developing a game for all platforms in JS
16:02 < oodavid> Reading between the lines I reckon they'll be around for an age
16:02 < oodavid> ^oh for sure
16:02 < oodavid> have you tinkered with the source code much?
16:03 < Godefroy> source code of GC?
16:03 < Godefroy> not really
16:03 < oodavid> yeah, some really excellent code in there
16:04 < oodavid> I've submitted a pull request relating to "animate" but am waiting for it to get accepted
16:04 < oodavid> hopefully soon, it's a refactor of the usual easings / tween libraries
16:13 < oodavid> Do you have a devlog anywhere? V. interested in your work
16:15 < Godefroy> not yet
16:15 < Godefroy> for now, I open source some contributions and some plugins on my github account: https://github.com/Godefroy?tab=repositories
16:16 < Godefroy> and we'll begin to talk about our game probably in 2-3 months
16:16 < Godefroy> we'll probably release it this summer
16:16 < oodavid> SO you have gaming experience already?
16:18 < oodavid> (tell me if I'm being annoying)
16:31 < Godefroy> I'm coding, so don't worry if I answer tens of minutes later :-)
16:32 < Godefroy> I developed and managed a browser game (in Flash with a socket server in Java) in 2005
16:32 < Godefroy> I was 16 and it was a great experience!
16:32 < Godefroy> after that, I developed www.eklablog.com, a french blogging platform
16:33 < Godefroy> now I built a little team and we have 10 millions unique visitors / month and the blogs we host
16:33 < Godefroy> oodavid: and you, what are you working on?
16:34 < oodavid> ^impressive resume good sir!
16:35 < oodavid> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaMVIdLbEpw < a very old prototype, it's a puzzle game based on building chemical compounds
16:35 < oodavid> wanted to make something original, but simple enough for a hobby
16:37 < oodavid> it's evolved quite a bit since then; I've been collating information on the Psychologicy of games / addiction - as you play the game you "unlock" cards that explain why it is presented as it is
16:42 < oodavid> My real weakness is design, layouts and proportion I can do, just not pretty pictures
16:43 < oodavid> I'm reluctant to get a designer or sound engineer on board till I have a playable prototype that I'm happy with
16:47 < PierrickB> It's one of the ahrd part
16:48 < PierrickB> We managed to get a awesome (really, a genius) graphist on board. He is the 4th and last associate
16:51 < PierrickB> And we got 2 graphist interns (they just started)
17:27 < debarko> catid, u there bro?
18:01 < oodavid> What's the scope of an imported file?
18:02 < oodavid> if I define variables outside of the "exports Class" closure are they local to that file?
18:18 < catid> good morning
18:18 < catid> only things you pass through "exports" are exported
18:21 < oodavid> splendid!
18:21 < oodavid> and good morning to you too
18:21 < oodavid> I've definitely over-engineered some of my variable logic, happy for the refactor cause it was nagging at me
18:22 < catid> will be here all day if you have other qs
18:22 < catid> i'm working on integrating zxing into the devkit
18:22 < catid> for QR code reading
19:54 < oodavid> ahh, QR codes, I see them everywhere but have to imagine there's a cohort of imaginary scanners
19:55 < oodavid> should really be a built in function of all phones
19:56 < oodavid> catid, is there a roadmap for GC? There's a google groups thread but it was hijacked by webview conversation
20:07 < catid> for a while now we've been working on a product full time, and any improvements to the devkit from that are shared with you all

13:20 < PierrickB> Any plan to integrate a analytics tool into GC ?

13:03 < scull> Hi everyone !
13:04 < scull> I'm requesting helo about leadbolt plugin on android. I've done all the procedure describe in the readme, on the simulator, logs are good, but in my android phone, ads are not shown and this line appear in logcat : E/JS      ( 2593): {plugins} WARNING: Unknown event could not be delivered for plugin: LeadBoltPlugin , method: leadBolt "
13:04 < scull> Have you got an idea about this issue ?
14:09 < rampr> scull: looks like it isn't implemented right
14:11 < scull> do you think plugin is not implemented right or my own code ?
14:11 < rampr> no the plugin itself
14:14 < rampr> showInterstitial in android isn't implemented
15:27 < scull> ah ok, thx$
15:27 < scull> So, i must use an other ad provider ?
16:39 < rampr> scull: if you can modify the plugin you can, must be easy I guess
16:39 < rampr> you'll have to implement showInterstitial in the android part of the plugin and the js also has to be slightly fixed
16:43 < rampr> you can try chartboost, I've tried it
17:30 < scull> Thx it works !
18:12 < catid> good morning
18:13 < catid> sorry rampr i haven't seen that issue.  if you can find out how to reproduce it reliably i'll be able to look at it

21:53 < oodavid> I've noticed that GC converts folders of images into spritesheets (by sniffing the network); does this mean that we get the advantages of spritesheets just by dumping images into the same folder and using ImageViews?
21:55 < catid> yes
21:55 < catid> it's best to separate images into the views that use them though
21:55 < catid> this way, on a real device fewer sprite sheets need to be loaded
21:55 < catid> so have subfolders for images that are used together
21:56 < catid> ie. button 9-slices etc
22:00 < oodavid> Excellent; that gives me more flexibility for moving sprites around etc
22:01 < oodavid> So (for example), a match-3 type game, it'd make sense to have all the sprites together as they'll get recycled (a lot), right?
23:00 < catid> yes our match-3 game works that way
23:14 < bhldev_> I've been thinking a lot about recreating a GC like view hierarchy in a lot of other game engines
23:14 < bhldev_> lol
23:15 < bhldev_> relative positioning, offsets, aspect ratio independent, etc.
23:24 < catid> we're basing it off other good examples :)
23:24 < catid> better schemes are more WYSIWYG, like storyboards on iOS
23:24 < catid> i'd love to have a drag-and-drop UI editor
23:40 < PierrickB> catid: Hi ! Maybe my question was not clear yesterday, about your plans. I was more thinking about planned upcoming features :)
23:43 < catid> oh
23:43 < catid> QR decoder/encoder is going in soon
--- Day changed Fri Jan 17 2014
00:17 < catid> it works on Android/iOS to produce base64-encoded PNGs you can display in place of the image URL
00:18 < catid> and you can also take photos and decode the photos to recover the text in the QR code
00:18 < catid> works with QR codes of URLs and things
00:36 < bhldev__> wysiwyg hrm
01:11 < PierrickB> Nice. So basic use of the phone's camera
01:21 < catid> yeah we already support the camera
01:22 < catid> another thing i want to add is the ability to display camera feed in real time for a QR scanning type app
01:22 < catid> it's in the works
04:02 < bhldev__> what do you think about component entity design pattern catid
06:52 < catid> never heard of it
06:52 < bhldev__> neither did I but someone recommended it for writing my own class hierarchy
06:53 < bhldev__> http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1f83c5/
06:59 < bhldev> anyway catid fyi I've gone back to java
06:59 < bhldev> lol
07:00 < bhldev> after a year of avoiding it I'm going back for many reasons
07:00 < catid> aww ok
07:00 < bhldev> well I'm keeping javascript around
07:00 < bhldev> don't worry
07:00 < bhldev> lol
07:00 < catid> oh yay
07:01 < bhldev> you do mostly c++?
07:01 < catid> yeah working on this project right now: https://github.com/catid/wirehair/
07:01 < catid> right now it has a 3% failure rate.. found a way to push that down to 0.001% and make it go faster this week, just need to write it
07:04 < bhldev> is 3% acceptable for udp lol
07:05 < catid> yeah it works out to about 26 bytes of overhead
07:05 < catid> or less.. depends on the size of the data
07:06 < catid> having better recovery rates makes it more applicable to file splitting-type apps
07:07 < catid> i've built it into a variable-length packet streaming library called Shorthair that essentially gives you a knob that lets you pick how much loss you want to experience over a wireless channel
07:07 < bhldev> that's pretty cool
07:07 < bhldev> now make it javascript and webrtc so I can use it
07:07 < bhldev> lol
07:07 < catid> heh
07:08 < catid> it will probably be part of the devkit eventually
07:09 < catid> i'm building a pretty cool network library based on a few things, want to hear more about it?
07:15 < bhldev> catid sure going to sleep soon tho
07:16 < catid> well briefly,
07:16 < catid> it uses a two byte header to identify connected clients to a server, so you can change IP addresses and keep sending data from the same connection
07:17 < catid> and also does a multihomed wifi + 3G connection trunk to fully use both channels
07:17 < catid> over that header it layers encryption, so the data is securely transported
07:17 < catid> within the encryption it runs a 5 byte header for error correction, so you can combat random packetloss over wireless channels
07:18 < catid> using shorthair/wirehair
07:18 < catid> and within the FEC layer it runs a transport layer that has several parallel streams of reliable-in-order data, reliable-out-of-order data, and unreliable data
07:18 < catid> all over UDP
07:19 < catid> with a fallback to TCP
07:19 < catid> the whole thing is written from the ground up in C++ using a lot of stuff i invented over the last few years
07:20 < bhldev> didn't know half that stuff was possible
07:20 < catid> and it provides the user of the library with a simple C style socket-style interface with a few extra parameters for username/password authentication
07:20 < bhldev> hope it catches on
07:21 < catid> it has a bunch of other bells/whistles like syn-cookie type stuff
07:21 < catid> but that's the gist of it
07:21 < bhldev> if you make it braindead simple like socket.io people will use it
07:21 < catid> yeah that's my goal
07:21 < catid> going to target mobile users mainly
07:22 < catid> and have plugins for e.g. Unity, ObjC, AndroidJava etc
07:22 < catid> best thing is, it's just a few months away from being done :D
07:23 < bhldev> very  interesting
07:24 < bhldev> will you have java too?
07:24 < bhldev> not sure how it would work in java
07:24 < catid> yeah i think Android's socket stuff is the same as normal desktop Java socket stuff
07:24 < catid> wouldn't be anything too special
07:24 < catid> on the server side i am just going to reuse libuv because they do things pretty well
07:25 < catid> a few years ago before libuv existed i was writing my own libuv-type thing
07:25 < catid> but that project was way too big for me and it died
07:25 < catid> this seems like just the right size project i can get it done
07:27 < bhldev> still seems quite large lol
07:27 < bhldev> you're supporting a lot of platforms
07:27 < catid> fortunately the majority of the code is portable C
07:27 < catid> it's just math code
07:27 < catid> i only have maybe 20 lines of assembly in the whole thing
07:27 < catid> with C fallbacks of course
07:28 < catid> it's also broken up into separate projects that i've been maintaining.. wirehair got me some contract work and it got a few improvements from that and some new stuff recently
07:29 < catid> the encryption stuff is all very new: https://github.com/catid/tabby/
07:29 < catid> just fixed a flaw in the protocol this morning
07:30 < catid> but it's pretty much wrapped up now
07:30 < catid> my buddy who owns RakNet is using it for encryption
07:30 < catid> will be in the next version
07:32 < bhldev> "your buddy who owns RakNet" lol
07:33 < bhldev> who else do you know ;p
07:33 < catid> i know the CEO of Game Closure ^_^;
07:33 < catid> iunno random people
07:33 < bhldev> if I had money and wanted fast to market
07:33 < bhldev> I might go evil and go microsoft and unity and use photon lol
07:34 < bhldev> that's the dream of all brogrammers, make a mmo with unity
07:34 < catid> yeah photon cloud is pretty cool
07:34 < catid> at some point i want to approach the devs of photon cloud and try to have then license my tech
07:35 < catid> what i want to do is sell this library as a commercial solution and try to get some big users like photon
07:35 < bhldev> oh not MIT?
07:35 < bhldev> btw know anything about 3d
07:35 < catid> no i'm pretty bad at 3d.. i've done a few 3d demos and read some intro books and looked at shader code
07:35 < bhldev> I started a blender course irl one of the reasons I'm starting java again and libgdx
07:36 < bhldev> ok
07:36 < catid> used lightwave when i was a kid :)
07:36 < bhldev> I was going to use babylon.js with a canvas accelerator too
07:36 < bhldev> it's fucking hard to find lgihtwave books
07:36 < bhldev> indigo and chapters don't seem tos tock them
07:36 < catid> yea now you can just use three.js lol
07:36 < catid> new world
07:37 < catid> i'm hoping to get a bunch of customers using the netcode library and attract a buyout from google or something like that
07:37 < catid> and i'd be a one-man shop with full ownership no VC
07:39 < catid> i don't understand startups these days
07:39 < catid> you shouldn't be able to go 3 years without actually selling anything
07:39 < catid> no business deals, no need to turn a profit
07:40 < catid> but still hiring like 20+ people
07:40 < catid> it just doesn't make sense
07:41 < catid> companies should be simple: you build something people want, and then you sell it.  and VCs should be there to take you from small scale to large scale operation
07:41 < catid> since when did it become "maybe one day i'll sell something, want to bet millions on it?"
07:45 < bhldev> well
07:46 < bhldev> only 1 in the 20 people will not be 9 to 5 or be excited enough
07:47 < bhldev> vcs work that way in the USA, failure almost assumed in Canada there is almost no tolerance for failure the market is too small
07:48 < bhldev> your startup bombing multiple times in the US seems to be a badge of honor
07:48 < bhldev> did you read my startup has 30 days to live
07:48 < bhldev> seems brutal
07:48 < catid> no didn't see that
07:50 < bhldev> lifestyle entrepreneur seems safer
07:55 < catid> nn
12:00 < scull> Hi everyone ! I'm trying to make my own android ad plugin to use admob in my games. But, I don't know how implement it : on admob sdk documentation, it said to include this java code : "setContentView(R.layout.main); LinearLayout layout = (LinearLayout)findViewById(R.id.mainLayout);layout.addView(adView);" But it doesn't works. I don't know  how to get the mainView ans the mainLayout. Have you got any idea ?
13:00 < scull> I've tried to follow this tutorial (AdMob on OpenGL ES), it's compile, but it doesn't works (the game is running, but no ads are display) : http://devblog.corpwar.net/2011/12/admob-with-opengl-es.html
13:07 < scull> anybody can help me ?

01:26 < PierrickB> Hey catid ! A quick question ; is there any way to get rid of GC cache ? We often have problems with 404 errors for assets which actually exists.
01:26 < PierrickB> exist*
11:58 < oodavid> is there a way to iterate over the "active" views in a viewPool?
11:59 < oodavid> Or even all the views for that matter, I can check the visibility
12:15 < oodavid> I see in timestep/ui/ViewPool.js I could access the internal property _views - I imagine using this will cause issues when compiled?
12:17 < oodavid> ...although... the adventuremap example accesses _views - I think I have a winner!
12:17 < oodavid> apologies for dumping :-)
16:29 < bhldev> I'm thinking of dumping half a year into opengl 2 catid what do you think
16:30 < bhldev> I can't really justify it, doesn't make sense with money and other options, only reason is if I don't learn programmable pipeline I'll feel like a faker lol
16:37 < bhldev> yeah just confirmed must know programmable pipeline to do graphics

17:30 < Godefroy> hi!
17:31 < Godefroy> do you know if GC handles circular dependencies correctly?
17:31 < Godefroy> I think I have an issue with that
18:05 < catid> good morning
18:05 < catid> we've iterated on that problem a couple times
18:05 < catid> it shows up again every now and then
18:05 < catid> so there's a chance something is still not ideal
18:06 < catid> i'm reasonably sure right now that normal View objects get garbage collected properly
18:06 < catid> but, it is easy to keep references to them by accident
18:06 < catid> the best way to deal with it, if you can, is to use view pools so you don't depend on GC
18:07 < catid> GC is a source of random latency anyway
18:07 < catid> so minimizing that is best
18:36 < oodavid> howdy all!
18:37 < catid> g'morning
18:45 < oodavid> Just popping on to say I had a most pleasurable weekend working with devkit
18:45 < oodavid> and to offer my thanks :-)
18:45 < catid> great!
18:45 < catid> i had a very good weekend *not* working on the devkit
18:46 < oodavid> pip pip!
18:46 < catid> looks like the QR code stuff is almost ready for release
18:46 < oodavid> the zxing addon?
18:46 < catid> dropped zxing - a friend pointed me at quirc, which is a lot faster and easier to integrate
18:47 < catid> the quirc developer responds via Email too
18:47 < oodavid> Never thought about it, I guess zxing has been around for a digital age
18:47 < oodavid> I'll look into quirc though, always useful
18:48 < catid> it may have some kind of limitation like only ASCII text etc
18:48 < catid> but i just want to encode short generated URLs so that works fine
18:49 < oodavid> code looks pretty tight
18:50 < oodavid> so is a lot of the work that goes into "integration" actually writing js emulators and documentation?
18:53 < catid> hm well for example, to get QR in I had to design how that will work first off
18:53 < catid> what JS API functions are needed, where to put them
18:54 < catid> what parameters are needed for a real application etc
18:54 < catid> then the implementation involved copying some old code I had lying around that does conversion to/from Base64
18:54 < catid> starting with zxing, ripping that out and going with quirc
18:55 < catid> had zxing working on iOS, then tried to get it working on Android and found it was a bear
18:55 < catid> writing a demo app that uses the feature so i can demo it at the company meetings
18:56 < catid> testing it under various conditions to see how large the QR code needs to be on the screen and what level of error correction coding to use
18:56 < oodavid> a lot of due diligence then!
18:57 < oodavid> do you have a lot of show and tell at company meetings?
18:57 < catid> i like to demo something every other week
18:57 < oodavid> always interested to know how companies like GC operate
18:57 < oodavid> ^that's an awesome way to keep momentum up
18:57 < catid> well last Friday it was all about my teammate and the CEO giving presentations on where we are going in the next few months
18:58 < catid> which was exciting to see
18:58 < catid> the week before that it was technical demos
18:59 < oodavid> sounds stimulating :-)
19:00 < oodavid> I am curious where you are headed, a while back you said you're working on a product full-time; am I right in assuming you also produce games anonymously for other companies?
19:00 < oodavid> there's a lot of mystique surrounding GC :D
19:02 < catid> sorry definitely can't talk about that stuff, but we will have something big to announce soon! :)
19:02 < oodavid> I've been reading too many detective novels :-)
19:03 < oodavid> But glad to hear!
19:03 < catid> i think the announcement happens either this week or next?
19:03 < oodavid> Ooooooh
19:04 < oodavid> I want GC merch
19:05 < catid> live in the SF bay area?

19:06 < oodavid> Although I'm trying to persuade my boss to send me on a US roadtrip for "essential conferences"
19:06 < catid> hrm, if you release a game on the devkit i'd certainly mail you something for contributing to the project.  seems fair
19:07 < oodavid> I'll hold you to that!
19:09 < oodavid> Don't suppose you know if my "animation" contributions will get pulled into devkit / timestep?
19:12 < oodavid> err, native-core and timestep rather
19:12 < oodavid> https://github.com/gameclosure/native-core/pull/2
19:13 < catid> lemme check
19:13 < catid> ah good
19:13 < catid> just inspecting to make sure the original functionality is still intact
19:15 < oodavid> I've a feeling there's more references to animation in other repos but not quite sure where to start, but happy to update the documentation
19:17 < catid> the existing stuff lgtm
19:17 < catid> will pull it in now
19:20 < oodavid> what a gent
19:24 < oodavid> Right then, I'm off to cook
19:24 < catid> later
19:24 < oodavid> might pop on tomorrow
19:24 < oodavid> good luck with that animation lark, don't sweat it if you want me to refactor etc.
